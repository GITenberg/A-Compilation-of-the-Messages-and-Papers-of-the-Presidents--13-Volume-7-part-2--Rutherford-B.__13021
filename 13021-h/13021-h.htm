<h2>
    Rutherford B. Hayes
</h2>
<p>
    Rutherford B. Hayes was born in Delaware: Ohio, October 4, 1822.
    His father had died in July, 1822, leaving his mother in modest
    circumstances. He attended the common schools, and began early the
    study of Latin and Greek with Judge Sherman Finch, of Delaware.
    Prepared for college at an academy at Norwalk, Ohio, and at a school
    in Middletown, Conn. In the autumn of 1838 entered Kenyon College,
    at Gambier, Ohio. Excelled in logic, mental and moral philosophy,
    and mathematics, and also made his mark as a debater in the literary
    societies. On his graduation, in August, 1842, was awarded the
    valedictory oration, with which he won much praise. Soon afterwards
    began the study of law in the office of Thomas Sparrow, at Columbus,
    Ohio, and then attended a course of law lectures at Harvard
    University, entering the law school August 22, 1843, and finishing his
    studies there in January, 1845. As a law student he had the advantage
    of friendly intercourse with Judge Story and Professor Greenleaf, and
    also attended the lectures of Longfellow on literature and of Agassiz
    on natural science, pursuing at the same time the study of French and
    German. In May, 1845, was admitted to practice in the courts of Ohio
    as an attorney and counselor at law. Established himself first at
    Lower Sandusky (now Fremont), where in April, 1846, he formed a law
    partnership with Ralph P. Buckland, then a Member of Congress. In the
    winter of 1849-50 established himself at Cincinnati. His practice at
    first being light, continued his studies in law and literature, and
    also became identified with various literary societies, among them
    the literary club of Cincinnati, where he met Salmon P. Chase, Thomas
    Ewing, Thomas Corwin, Stanley Matthews, Moncure D. Conway, Manning F.
    Force, and others of note. December 30, 1852, married Miss Lucy Ware
    Webb, daughter of Dr. James Webb, a physician of Chillicothe, Ohio. In
    January, 1854, formed a law partnership with H.W. Corwine and William
    K. Rogers. In 1856 was nominated for the office of common pleas judge,
    but declined. In 1858 was elected city solicitor by the city council
    of Cincinnati to fill a vacancy, and in the following year was
    elected to the same office at a popular election, but was defeated
    for reelection in 1861. After becoming a voter he acted with the Whig
    party, voting for Henry Clay in 1844, for General Taylor in 1848, and
    for General Scott in 1852. Having from his youth cherished antislavery
    feelings, he joined the Republican party as soon as it was organized,
    and earnestly advocated the election of Frémont in 1856 and of Lincoln
    in 1860. At a great mass meeting held in Cincinnati immediately
    after the firing on Fort Sumter was made chairman of a committee on
    resolutions. His literary club formed a military company, of which he
    was elected captain. June 7, 1861, was appointed by the governor of
    Ohio major of the Twenty-third Ohio Volunteers. September 19, 1861,
    was appointed by General Rosecrans judge-advocate of the Department
    of the Ohio. October 24, 1861, was promoted to the rank of
    lieutenant-colonel. In the battle of South Mountain, September 14,
    1862, distinguished himself by gallant conduct in leading a charge and
    in holding a position at the head of his troops after being severely
    wounded in his left arm. October 24, 1862, was appointed colonel
    of the Twenty-third Ohio. In July, 1863, while with the army in
    southwestern Virginia, caused an expedition of two regiments and a
    section of artillery under his command to be dispatched to Ohio for
    the purpose of checking the raid of the Confederate general John
    Morgan, and aided materially in preventing the raiders from recrossing
    the Ohio River and in compelling Morgan to surrender. In the spring
    of 1864 commanded a brigade in General Crook's expedition to cut the
    principal lines of communication between Richmond and the Southwest.
    Distinguished himself by conspicuous bravery at the head of his
    brigade in storming a fortified position on the crest of Cloyd
    Mountain. Commanded a brigade in the first battle of Winchester. Took
    a creditable part in the engagement at Berryville, and at the second
    battle of Winchester, September 19, 1864, performed a feat of great
    bravery. Leading an assault upon a battery on an eminence, he found in
    his way a morass over 50 yards wide. Being at the head of his brigade,
    he plunged in first, and, his horse becoming mired at once, he
    dismounted and waded across alone under the enemy's fire. Signaled his
    men to come over, and when about 40 had joined him he rushed upon the
    battery and captured it after a hand-to-hand fight. At Fishers Hill,
    September 22, 1864, being then in command of a division, executed a
    brilliant flank movement over mountains and through woods, took many
    pieces of artillery, and routed the enemy. At the battle of Cedar
    Creek, October 19, 1864, his conduct attracted so much attention that
    his commander, General Crook, commended him, saying, "Colonel, from
    this day you will be a brigadier-general." The commission reached him
    a few days afterwards. March 13, 1865, received the rank of brevet
    major-general "for gallant and distinguished services during the
    campaign of 1864 in West Virginia, and particularly at the battles of
    Fishers Hill and Cedar Creek, Virginia." In August, 1864, while in the
    field, was nominated for Congress and elected. After the war, returned
    to civil life, and took his seat in Congress December 4, 1865. Voted
    with his party on questions connected with the reconstruction of the
    Southern States; supported a resolution declaring the sacredness of
    the public debt and denouncing repudiation, and also one commending
    President Johnson for declining to accept presents and condemning the
    practice; opposed a resolution favoring an increase of pay of members
    of Congress; introduced in a Republican caucus resolutions declaring
    that the only mode of obtaining from the States lately in rebellion
    irreversible guaranties was by constitutional amendment, and that
    an amendment basing representation upon voters instead of population
    ought to be acted upon without delay. In August, 1866, was renominated
    for Congress by acclamation, and was reelected. Supported the
    impeachment of President Johnson. In June, 1867, was nominated for
    governor of Ohio, and at the election defeated Judge Allen G. Thurman.
    In June, 1869, was again nominated for governor, and at the election
    defeated George H. Pendleton. At the expiration of his term as
    governor declined to be a candidate for the United States Senate
    against John Sherman. In 1872 was again nominated for Congress, but at
    the election was defeated. Declined the office of assistant treasurer
    of the United States at Cincinnati. In 1873 established his home at
    Fremont with the intention of retiring from public life. In 1875 was
    again nominated for governor of Ohio, and at the election defeated
    William Allen. Was nominated for President of the United States at
    the national Republican convention at Cincinnati on June 16, 1876. The
    Democrats selected as their candidate Samuel J. Tilden, of New York.
    The result of the election became the subject of acrimonious dispute.
    Each party charged fraud upon the other, and both parties claimed to
    have carried the States of Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida.
    To avoid a deadlock, which might have happened if the canvass of
    the electoral votes had been left to the two Houses of Congress
    (the Senate having a Republican and the House of Representatives a
    Democratic majority), an act, advocated by members of both parties,
    was passed to refer all contested cases to a commission composed of
    five Senators, five Representatives, and five Justices of the Supreme
    Court, the decision of this commission to be final unless set aside
    by a concurrent vote of the two Houses of Congress. The commission,
    refusing to go behind the certificates of the governors, decided in
    each contested case by a vote of 8 to 7 in favor of the Republican
    electors, beginning with Florida on February 7, and on March 2 Mr.
    Hayes was declared duly elected President of the United States. Was
    inaugurated March 5, 1877. At the expiration of his term returned to
    his home at Fremont, Ohio. Was the recipient of various distinctions.
    The degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him by Kenyon College, Harvard
    University, Yale College, and Johns Hopkins University. Was made
    senior vice-commander of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion,
    commander of the Ohio commandery of the same order, first president
    of the Society of the Army of West Virginia, and president of the
    Twenty-third Regiment Ohio Volunteers Association. Was president of
    the trustees of the John F. Slater education fund; one of the trustees
    of the Peabody education fund; president of the National Prison
    Reform Association; an active member of the National Conference
    of Corrections and Charities; a trustee of the Western Reserve
    University, at Cleveland, Ohio, of the Wesleyan University, of
    Delaware, Ohio, of Mount Union College, at Alliance, Ohio, and of the
    Ohio State University. He died at Fremont, Ohio, January 17, 1893, and
    was buried there.

<h2>
    INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
</h2>
<p>
    FELLOW-CITIZENS: We have assembled to repeat the public ceremonial,
    begun by Washington, observed by all my predecessors, and now a
    time-honored custom, which marks the commencement of a new term of
    the Presidential office. Called to the duties of this great trust,
    I proceed, in compliance with usage, to announce some of the leading
    principles, on the subjects that now chiefly engage the public
    attention, by which it is my desire to be guided in the discharge of
    those duties. I shall not undertake to lay down irrevocably principles
    or measures of administration, but rather to speak of the motives
    which should animate us, and to suggest certain important ends to
    be attained in accordance with our institutions and essential to the
    welfare of our country.
</p>
<p>
    At the outset of the discussions which preceded the recent
    Presidential election it seemed to me fitting that I should fully make
    known my sentiments in regard to several of the important questions
    which then appeared to demand the consideration of the country.
    Following the example, and in part adopting the language, of one of my
    predecessors, I wish now, when every motive for misrepresentation has
    passed away, to repeat what was said before the election, trusting
    that my countrymen will candidly weigh and understand it, and that
    they will feel assured that the sentiments declared in accepting the
    nomination for the Presidency will be the standard of my conduct in
    the path before me, charged, as I now am, with the grave and difficult
    task of carrying them out in the practical administration of the
    Government so far as depends, under the Constitution and laws, on the
    Chief Executive of the nation.
</p>
<p>
    The permanent pacification of the country upon such principles and
    by such measures as will secure the complete protection of all its
    citizens in the free enjoyment of all their constitutional rights is
    now the one subject in our public affairs which all thoughtful and
    patriotic citizens regard as of supreme importance.
</p>
<p>
    Many of the calamitous effects of the tremendous revolution which
    has passed over the Southern States still remain. The immeasurable
    benefits which will surely follow, sooner or later, the hearty and
    generous acceptance of the legitimate results of that revolution have
    not yet been realized. Difficult and embarrassing questions meet us
    at the threshold of this subject. The people of those States are
    still impoverished, and the inestimable blessing of wise, honest,
    and peaceful local self-government is not fully enjoyed. Whatever
    difference of opinion may exist as to the cause of this condition of
    things, the fact is clear that in the progress of events the time has
    come when such government is the imperative necessity required by all
    the varied interests, public and private, of those States. But it must
    not be forgotten that only a local government which recognizes and
    maintains inviolate the rights of all is a true self-government.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to the two distinct races whose peculiar relations to
    each other have brought upon us the deplorable complications and
    perplexities which exist in those States, it must be a government
    which guards the interests of both races carefully and equally.
    It must be a government which submits loyally and heartily to the
    Constitution and the laws&mdash;the laws of the nation and the laws of
    the States themselves&mdash;accepting and obeying faithfully the whole
    Constitution as it is.
</p>
<p>
    Resting upon this sure and substantial foundation, the superstructure
    of beneficent local governments can be built up, and not otherwise.
    In furtherance of such obedience to the letter and the spirit of the
    Constitution, and in behalf of all that its attainment implies, all
    so-called party interests lose their apparent importance, and party
    lines may well be permitted to fade into insignificance. The question
    we have to consider for the immediate welfare of those States of the
    Union is the question of government or no government; of social order
    and all the peaceful industries and the happiness that belong to it,
    or a return to barbarism. It is a question in which every citizen of
    the nation is deeply interested, and with respect to which we ought
    not to be, in a partisan sense, either Republicans or Democrats, but
    fellow-citizens and fellow-men, to whom the interests of a common
    country and a common humanity are dear.
</p>
<p>
    The sweeping revolution of the entire labor system of a large portion
    of our country and the advance of 4,000,000 people from a condition
    of servitude to that of citizenship, upon an equal footing with their
    former masters, could not occur without presenting problems of the
    gravest moment, to be dealt with by the emancipated race, by their
    former masters, and by the General Government, the author of the
    act of emancipation. That it was a wise, just, and providential
    act, fraught with good for all concerned, is now generally conceded
    throughout the country. That a moral obligation rests upon the
    National Government to employ its constitutional power and influence
    to establish the rights of the people it has emancipated, and to
    protect them in the enjoyment of those rights when they are infringed
    or assailed, is also generally admitted.
</p>
<p>
    The evils which afflict the Southern States can only be removed or
    remedied by the united and harmonious efforts of both races, actuated
    by motives of mutual sympathy and regard; and while in duty bound and
    fully determined to protect the rights of all by every constitutional
    means at the disposal of my Administration, I am sincerely anxious to
    use every legitimate influence in favor of honest and efficient
    local <i>self</i>-government as the true resource of those States for the
    promotion of the contentment and prosperity of their citizens. In
    the effort I shall make to accomplish this purpose I ask the cordial
    cooperation of all who cherish an interest in the welfare of the
    country, trusting that party ties and the prejudice of race will be
    freely surrendered in behalf of the great purpose to be accomplished.
    In the important work of restoring the South it is not the political
    situation alone that merits attention. The material development
    of that section of the country has been arrested by the social and
    political revolution through which it has passed, and now needs and
    deserves the considerate care of the National Government within the
    just limits prescribed by the Constitution and wise public economy.
</p>
<p>
    But at the basis of all prosperity, for that as well as for every
    other part of the country, lies the improvement of the intellectual
    and moral condition of the people. Universal suffrage should rest
    upon universal education. To this end, liberal and permanent
    provision should be made for the support of free schools by the State
    governments, and, if need be, supplemented by legitimate aid from
    national authority.
</p>
<p>
    Let me assure my countrymen of the Southern States that it is my
    earnest desire to regard and promote their truest interests&mdash;the
    interests of the white and of the colored people both and equally&mdash;and
    to put forth my best efforts in behalf of a civil policy which will
    forever wipe out in our political affairs the color line and the
    distinction between North and South, to the end that we may have not
    merely a united North or a united South, but a united country.
</p>
<p>
    I ask the attention of the public to the paramount necessity of reform
    in our civil service&mdash;a reform not merely as to certain abuses and
    practices of so-called official patronage which have come to have the
    sanction of usage in the several Departments of our Government, but
    a change in the system of appointment itself; a reform that shall
    be thorough, radical, and complete; a return to the principles and
    practices of the founders of the Government. They neither expected
    nor desired from public officers any partisan service. They meant that
    public officers should owe their whole service to the Government and
    to the people. They meant that the officer should be secure in his
    tenure as long as his personal character remained untarnished and the
    performance of his duties satisfactory. They held that appointments to
    office were not to be made nor expected merely as rewards for partisan
    services, nor merely on the nomination of members of Congress, as
    being entitled in any respect to the control of such appointments.
</p>
<p>
    The fact that both the great political parties of the country, in
    declaring their principles prior to the election, gave a prominent
    place to the subject of reform of our civil service, recognizing and
    strongly urging its necessity, in terms almost identical in their
    specific import with those I have here employed, must be accepted as
    a conclusive argument in behalf of these measures. It must be regarded
    as the expression of the united voice and will of the whole country
    upon this subject, and both political parties are virtually pledged
    to give it their unreserved support.
</p>
<p>
    The President of the United States of necessity owes his election to
    office to the suffrage and zealous labors of a political party,
    the members of which cherish with ardor and regard as of essential
    importance the principles of their party organization; but he should
    strive to be always mindful of the fact that he serves his party best
    who serves the country best.
</p>
<p>
    In furtherance of the reform we seek, and in other important respects
    a change of great importance, I recommend an amendment to the
    Constitution prescribing a term of six years for the Presidential
    office and forbidding a reelection.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to the financial condition of the country, I shall not
    attempt an extended history of the embarrassment and prostration which
    we have suffered during the past three years. The depression in all
    our varied commercial and manufacturing interests throughout the
    country, which began in September, 1873, still continues. It is very
    gratifying, however, to be able to say that there are indications all
    around us of a coming change to prosperous times.
</p>
<p>
    Upon the currency question, intimately connected, as it is, with this
    topic, I may be permitted to repeat here the statement made in my
    letter of acceptance, that in my judgment the feeling of uncertainty
    inseparable from an irredeemable paper currency, with its fluctuation
    of values, is one of the greatest obstacles to a return to prosperous
    times. The only safe paper currency is one which rests upon a coin
    basis and is at all times and promptly convertible into coin.
</p>
<p>
    I adhere to the views heretofore expressed by me in favor of
    Congressional legislation in behalf of an early resumption of specie
    payments, and I am satisfied not only that this is wise, but that
    the interests, as well as the public sentiment, of the country
    imperatively demand it.
</p>
<p>
    Passing from these remarks upon the condition of our own country
    to consider our relations with other lands, we are reminded by the
    international complications abroad, threatening the peace of Europe,
    that our traditional rule of noninterference in the affairs of foreign
    nations has proved of great value in past times and ought to be
    strictly observed.
</p>
<p>
    The policy inaugurated by my honored predecessor, President Grant, of
    submitting to arbitration grave questions in dispute between ourselves
    and foreign powers points to a new, and incomparably the best,
    instrumentality for the preservation of peace, and will, as I believe,
    become a beneficent example of the course to be pursued in similar
    emergencies by other nations.
</p>
<p>
    If, unhappily, questions of difference should at any time during the
    period of my Administration arise between the United States and any
    foreign government, it will certainly be my disposition and my hope to
    aid in their settlement in the same peaceful and honorable way, thus
    securing to our country the great blessings of peace and mutual good
    offices with all the nations of the world.
</p>
<p>
    Fellow-citizens, we have reached the close of a political contest
    marked by the excitement which usually attends the contests between
    great political parties whose members espouse and advocate with
    earnest faith their respective creeds. The circumstances were,
    perhaps, in no respect extraordinary save in the closeness and the
    consequent uncertainty of the result.
</p>
<p>
    For the first time in the history of the country it has been deemed
    best, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case, that the
    objections and questions in dispute with reference to the counting of
    the electoral votes should be referred to the decision of a tribunal
    appointed for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
    That tribunal&mdash;established by law for this sole purpose; its members,
    all of them, men of long-established reputation for integrity and
    intelligence, and, with the exception of those who are also members of
    the supreme judiciary, chosen equally from both political parties; its
    deliberations enlightened by the research and the arguments of able
    counsel&mdash;was entitled to the fullest confidence of the American
    people. Its decisions have been patiently waited for, and accepted
    as legally conclusive by the general judgment of the public. For the
    present, opinion will widely vary as to the wisdom of the several
    conclusions announced by that tribunal. This is to be anticipated
    in every instance where matters of dispute are made the subject of
    arbitration under the forms of law. Human judgment is never unerring,
    and is rarely regarded as otherwise than wrong by the unsuccessful
    party in the contest.
</p>
<p>
    The fact that two great political parties have in this way settled a
    dispute in regard to which good men differ as to the facts and the
    law no less than as to the proper course to be pursued in solving the
    question in controversy is an occasion for general rejoicing.
</p>
<p>
    Upon one point there is entire unanimity in public sentiment&mdash;that
    conflicting claims to the Presidency must be amicably and peaceably
    adjusted, and that when so adjusted the general acquiescence of the
    nation ought surely to follow.
</p>
<p>
    It has been reserved for a government of the people, where the right
    of suffrage is universal, to give to the world the first example in
    history of a great nation, in the midst of the struggle of opposing
    parties for power, hushing its party tumults to yield the issue of
    the contest to adjustment according to the forms of law.
</p>
<p>
    Looking for the guidance of that Divine Hand by which the destinies
    of nations and individuals are shaped, I call upon you, Senators,
    Representatives, judges, fellow-citizens, here and everywhere, to
    unite with me in an earnest effort to secure to our country the
    blessings, not only of material prosperity, but of justice, peace, and
    union&mdash;a union depending not upon the constraint of force, but upon
    the loving devotion of a free people; "and that all things may be
    so ordered and settled upon the best and surest foundations that
    peace and happiness, truth and justice, religion and piety, may be
    established among us for all generations."

<p>
    Whereas the final adjournment of the Forty-fourth Congress without
    making the usual appropriations for the support of the Army for the
    fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, presents an extraordinary occasion
    requiring the President to exercise the power vested in him by the
    Constitution to convene the Houses of Congress in anticipation of the
    day fixed by law for their next meeting:
</p>
<p>
    Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United
    States, do, by virtue of the power to this end in me vested by the
    Constitution, convene both Houses of Congress to assemble at their
    respective chambers at 12 o'clock noon on Monday, the 15th day of
    October next, then and there to consider and determine such measures
    as in their wisdom their duty and the welfare of the people may seem

<p>
    MY DEAR SIR: I have read the partial report of the commission
    appointed to examine the New York custom-house. I concur with the
    commission in their recommendations. It is my wish that the collection
    of the revenues should be free from partisan control, and organized on
    a strictly business basis, with the same guaranties for efficiency and
    fidelity in the selection of the chief and subordinate officers that
    would be required by a prudent merchant. Party leaders should have
    no more influence in appointments than other equally respectable
    citizens. No assessments for political purposes on officers or
    subordinates should be allowed. No useless officer or employee should
    be retained. No officer should be required or permitted to take part
    in the management of political organizations, caucuses, conventions,
    or election campaigns. Their right to vote and to express their
    views on public questions, either orally or through the press, is not
    denied, provided it does not interfere with the discharge of their
    official duties.

</p>
<p>
    This rule is applicable to every department of the civil service. It

<h2>
    SPECIAL SESSION MESSAGE.
</h2>
<p class="r">
    WASHINGTON, <i>October 15, 1877.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    The adjournment of the last Congress without making appropriations
    for the support of the Army for the present fiscal year has rendered
    necessary a suspension of payments to the officers and men of the sums
    due them for services rendered after the 30th day of June last.
    The Army exists by virtue of statutes which prescribe its numbers,
    regulate its organization and employment, and which fix the pay of its
    officers and men and declare their right to receive the same at stated
    periods. These statutes, however, do not authorize the payment of
    the troops in the absence of specific appropriations therefor. The
    Constitution has wisely provided that "no money shall be drawn from
    the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law;" and
    it has also been declared by statute that "no department of the
    Government shall expend in any one fiscal year any sum in excess
    of appropriations made by Congress for that fiscal year." We have,
    therefore, an Army in service, authorized by law and entitled to be
    paid, but no funds available for that purpose.
</p>
<p>
    It may also be said, as an additional incentive to prompt action by
    Congress, that since the commencement of the fiscal year the Army,
    though without pay, has been constantly and actively employed in
    arduous and dangerous service, in the performance of which both
    officers and men have discharged their duty with fidelity and
    courage and without complaint. These circumstances, in my judgment,
    constituted an extraordinary occasion requiring that Congress be
    convened in advance of the time prescribed by law for your meeting in
    regular session. The importance of speedy action upon this subject
    on the part of Congress is so manifest that I venture to suggest the
    propriety of making the necessary appropriations for the support
    of the Army for the current year at its present maximum numerical
    strength of 25,000 men, leaving for future consideration all questions
    relating to an increase or decrease of the number of enlisted men.
    In the event of the reduction of the Army by subsequent legislation
    during the fiscal year, the excess of the appropriation could not
    be expended; and in the event of its enlargement the additional sum
    required for the payment of the extra force could be provided in due
    time. It would be unjust to the troops now in service, and whose pay
    is already largely in arrears, if payment to them should be further
    postponed until after Congress shall have considered all the questions
    likely to arise in the effort to fix the proper limit to the strength
    of the Army.
</p>
<p>
    Estimates of appropriations for the support of the military
    establishment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, were
    transmitted to Congress by the former Secretary of the Treasury at the
    opening of its session in December last. These estimates, modified by
    the present Secretary so as to conform to present requirements, are
    now renewed, amounting to $32,436,764.98, and, having been transmitted
    to both Houses of Congress, are submitted for your consideration.
</p>
<p>
    There is also required by the Navy Department $2,003,861.24. This sum
    is made up of $1,446,688.16 due to officers and enlisted men for the
    last quarter of the last fiscal year; $311,953.50 due for advances
    made by the fiscal agent of the Government in London for the support
    of the foreign service; $50,000 due to the naval-hospital fund;
    $150,000 due for arrearages of pay to officers, and $45,219.58 for the
    support of the Marine Corps.
</p>
<p>
    There will also be needed an appropriation of $262,535.22 to defray
    the unsettled expenses of the United States courts for the fiscal year
    ending June 30 last, now due to attorneys, clerks, commissioners, and
    marshals, and for rent of court rooms, the support of prisoners, and
    other deficiencies.
</p>
<p>
    A part of the building of the Interior Department was destroyed by
    fire on the 24th of last month. Some immediate repairs and temporary
    structures have in consequence become necessary, estimates for which
    will be transmitted to Congress immediately, and an appropriation of
    the requisite funds is respectfully recommended.
</p>
<p>
    The Secretary of the Treasury will communicate to Congress, in
    connection with the estimates for the appropriations for the support
    of the Army for the current fiscal year, estimates for such other
    deficiencies in the different branches of the public service as
    require immediate action and can not without inconvenience be
    postponed until the regular session.
</p>
<p>
    I take this opportunity also to invite your attention to the propriety
    of adopting at your present session the necessary legislation
    to enable the people of the United States to participate in the
    advantages of the International Exhibition of Agriculture, Industry,
    and the Fine Arts which is to be held at Paris in 1878, and in which
    this Government has been invited by the Government of France to take
    part.
</p>
<p>
    This invitation was communicated to this Government in May, 1876,
    by the minister of France at this capital, and a copy thereof was
    submitted to the proper committees of Congress at its last session,
    but no action was taken upon the subject.
</p>
<p>
    The Department of State has received many letters from various parts
    of the country expressing a desire to participate in the exhibition,
    and numerous applications of a similar nature have also been made at
    the United States legation at Paris.
</p>
<p>
    The Department of State has also received official advice of the
    strong desire on the part of the French Government that the United
    States should participate in this enterprise, and space has hitherto
    been and still is reserved in the exhibition buildings for the use of
    exhibitors from the United States, to the exclusion of other parties
    who have been applicants therefor.
</p>
<p>
    In order that our industries may be properly represented at the
    exhibition, an appropriation will be needed for the payment of
    salaries and expenses of commissioners, for the transportation of
    goods, and for other purposes in connection with the object in view;
    and as May next is the time fixed for the opening of the exhibition,
    if our citizens are to share the advantages of this international
    competition for the trade of other nations the necessity of immediate
    action is apparent.
</p>
<p>
    To enable the United States to cooperate in the international
    exhibition which was held at Vienna in 1873, Congress then passed a
    joint resolution making an appropriation of $200,000 and authorizing
    the President to appoint a certain number of practical artisans and
    scientific men who should attend the exhibition and report their
    proceedings and observations to him. Provision was also made for the
    appointment of a number of honorary commissioners.
</p>
<p>
    I have felt that prompt action by Congress in accepting the invitation
    of the Government of France is of so much interest to the people of
    this country and so suitable to the cordial relations between the
    Governments of the two countries that the subject might properly be
    presented for attention at your present session.
</p>
<p>
    The Government of Sweden and Norway has addressed an official
    invitation to this Government to take part in the International Prison
    Congress to be held at Stockholm next year. The problem which the
    congress proposes to study&mdash;how to diminish crime&mdash;is one in which
    all civilized nations have an interest in common, and the congress
    of Stockholm seems likely to prove the most important convention ever
    held for the study of this grave question. Under authority of a joint
    resolution of Congress approved February 16, 1875, a commissioner was
    appointed by my predecessor to represent the United States upon that
    occasion, and the Prison Congress having been, at the earnest desire
    of the Swedish Government, postponed to 1878, his commission was
    renewed by me. An appropriation of $8,000 was made in the sundry civil
    act of 1875 to meet the expenses of the commissioner. I recommend
    the reappropriation of that sum for the same purpose, the former
    appropriation having been covered into the Treasury and being no
    longer available for the purpose without further action by Congress.
    The subject is brought to your attention at this time in view of
    circumstances which render it highly desirable that the commissioner
    should proceed to the discharge of his important duties immediately.
</p>
<p>
    As the several acts of Congress providing for detailed reports from
    the different Departments of the Government require their submission
    at the beginning of the regular annual session, I defer until that
    time any further reference to subjects of public interest.

<h2>
    PROCLAMATION.
</h2>
<h3>
    BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
</h3>
<h4>
    A PROCLAMATION.
</h4>
<p>
    The completed circle of summer and winter, seedtime and harvest,
    has brought us to the accustomed season at which a religious people
    celebrates with praise and thanksgiving the enduring mercy of Almighty
    God. This devout and public confession of the constant dependence of
    man upon the divine favor for all the good gifts of life and health
    and peace and happiness, so early in our history made the habit of
    our people, finds in the survey of the past year new grounds for its
    joyful and grateful manifestation.
</p>
<p>
    In all the blessings which depend upon benignant seasons, this has
    indeed been a memorable year. Over the wide territory of our country,
    with all its diversity of soil and climate and products, the earth has
    yielded a bountiful return to the labor of the husbandman. The
    health of the people has been blighted by no prevalent or widespread
    diseases. No great disasters of shipwreck upon our coasts or to our
    commerce on the seas have brought loss and hardship to merchants or
    mariners and clouded the happiness of the community with sympathetic
    sorrow.
</p>
<p>
    In all that concerns our strength and peace and greatness as a nation;
    in all that touches the permanence and security of our Government and
    the beneficent institutions on which it rests; in all that affects
    the character and dispositions of our people and tests our capacity
    to enjoy and uphold the equal and free condition of society, now
    permanent and universal throughout the land, the experience of the
    last year is conspicuously marked by the protecting providence of God
    and is full of promise and hope for the coming generations.
</p>
<p>
    Under a sense of these infinite obligations to the Great Ruler of
    Times and Seasons and Events, let us humbly ascribe it to our own
    faults and frailties if in any degree that perfect concord and
    happiness, peace and justice, which such great mercies should diffuse
    through the hearts and lives of our people do not altogether and
    always and everywhere prevail. Let us with one spirit and with one
    voice lift up praise and thanksgiving to God for His manifold goodness
    to our land, His manifest care for our nation.
</p>
<p>
    Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United
    States, do appoint Thursday, the 29th day of November next, as a day
    of national thanksgiving and prayer; and I earnestly recommend that,
    withdrawing themselves from secular cares and labors, the people of
    the United States do meet together on that day in their respective
    places of worship, there to give thanks and praise to Almighty God for
    His mercies and to devoutly beseech their continuance.
</p>
<p>
    In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of
    the United States to be affixed.

    I lament the sad occasion which makes it my duty to testify the public
    respect for the eminent citizen and distinguished statesman whose
    death yesterday at his home in Indianapolis has been made known to the
    people by telegraphic announcement.
</p>
<p>
    The services of Oliver P. Morton to the nation in the difficult and
    responsible administration of the affairs of the State of Indiana
    as its governor at a critical juncture of the civil war can never be
    overvalued by his countrymen. His long service in the Senate has shown
    his great powers as a legislator and as a leader and chief counselor
    of the political party charged with the conduct of the Government
    during that period.
</p>
<p>
    In all things and at all times he has been able, strenuous, and
    faithful in the public service, and his fame with his countrymen rests
    upon secure foundations.
</p>
<p>
    The several Executive Departments will be closed on the day of his
    funeral, and appropriate honors should be paid to the memory of the
    deceased statesman by the whole nation.

<h2>
    FIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.
</h2>
<p class="r">
    DECEMBER 3, 1877.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:</i>
</p>
<p>
    With devout gratitude to the bountiful Giver of All Good, I
    congratulate you that at the beginning of your first regular session
    you find our country blessed with health and peace and abundant
    harvests, and with encouraging prospects of an early return of general
    prosperity.
</p>
<p>
    To complete and make permanent the pacification of the country
    continues to be, and until it is fully accomplished must remain, the
    most important of all our national interests. The earnest purpose of
    good citizens generally to unite their efforts in this endeavor is
    evident. It found decided expression in the resolutions announced in
    1876 by the national conventions of the leading political parties of
    the country. There was a widespread apprehension that the momentous
    results in our progress as a nation marked by the recent amendments
    to the Constitution were in imminent jeopardy; that the good
    understanding which prompted their adoption, in the interest of a
    loyal devotion to the general welfare, might prove a barren truce, and
    that the two sections of the country, once engaged in civil strife,
    might be again almost as widely severed and disunited as they were
    when arrayed in arms against each other.
</p>
<p>
    The course to be pursued, which, in my judgment, seemed wisest in
    the presence of this emergency, was plainly indicated in my inaugural
    address. It pointed to the time, which all our people desire to see,
    when a genuine love of our whole country and of all that concerns
    its true welfare shall supplant the destructive forces of the mutual
    animosity of races and of sectional hostility. Opinions have differed
    widely as to the measures best calculated to secure this great end.
    This was to be expected. The measures adopted by the Administration
    have been subjected to severe and varied criticism. Any course
    whatever which might have been entered upon would certainly have
    encountered distrust and opposition. These measures were, in my
    judgment, such as were most in harmony with the Constitution and
    with the genius of our people, and best adapted, under all the
    circumstances, to attain the end in view. Beneficent results, already
    apparent, prove that these endeavors are not to be regarded as a
    mere experiment, and should sustain and encourage us in our efforts.
    Already, in the brief period which has elapsed, the immediate
    effectiveness, no less than the justice, of the course pursued is
    demonstrated, and I have an abiding faith that time will furnish
    its ample vindication in the minds of the great majority of my
    fellow-citizens. The discontinuance of the use of the Army for the
    purpose of upholding local governments in two States of the Union was
    no less a constitutional duty and requirement, under the circumstances
    existing at the time, than it was a much-needed measure for the
    restoration of local self-government and the promotion of national
    harmony. The withdrawal of the troops from such employment was
    effected deliberately, and with solicitous care for the peace and good
    order of society and the protection of the property and persons and
    every right of all classes of citizens.
</p>
<p>
    The results that have followed are indeed significant and encouraging.
    All apprehension of danger from remitting those States to local
    self-government is dispelled, and a most salutary change in the minds
    of the people has begun and is in progress in every part of that
    section of the country once the theater of unhappy civil strife,
    substituting for suspicion, distrust, and aversion, concord,
    friendship, and patriotic attachment to the Union. No unprejudiced
    mind will deny that the terrible and often fatal collisions which for
    several years have been of frequent occurrence and have agitated and
    alarmed the public mind have almost entirely ceased, and that a spirit
    of mutual forbearance and hearty national interest has succeeded.
    There has been a general reestablishment of order and of the orderly
    administration of justice. Instances of remaining lawlessness have
    become of rare occurrence; political turmoil and turbulence have
    disappeared; useful industries have been resumed; public credit in
    the Southern States has been greatly strengthened, and the encouraging
    benefits of a revival of commerce between the sections of the country
    lately embroiled in civil war are fully enjoyed. Such are some of
    the results already attained, upon which the country is to be
    congratulated. They are of such importance that we may with confidence
    patiently await the desired consummation that will surely come with
    the natural progress of events.
</p>
<p>
    It may not be improper here to say that it should be our fixed and
    unalterable determination to protect by all available and proper means
    under the Constitution and the laws the lately emancipated race in
    the enjoyment of their rights and privileges; and I urge upon those
    to whom heretofore the colored people have sustained the relation of
    bondmen the wisdom and justice of humane and liberal local legislation
    with respect to their education and general welfare. A firm adherence
    to the laws, both national and State, as to the civil and political
    rights of the colored people, now advanced to full and equal
    citizenship; the immediate repression and sure punishment by the
    national and local authorities, within their respective jurisdictions,
    of every instance of lawlessness and violence toward them, is required
    for the security alike of both races, and is justly demanded by the
    public opinion of the country and the age. In this way the restoration
    of harmony and good will and the complete protection of every citizen
    in the full enjoyment of every constitutional right will surely be
    attained. Whatever authority rests with me to this end I shall not
    hesitate to put forth.
</p>
<p>
    Whatever belongs to the power of Congress and the jurisdiction of the
    courts of the Union, they may confidently be relied upon to provide
    and perform; and to the legislatures, the courts, and the executive
    authorities of the several States I earnestly appeal to secure, by
    adequate, appropriate, and seasonable means, within their borders,
    these common and uniform rights of a united people which loves
    liberty, abhors oppression, and reveres justice. These objects are
    very dear to my heart. I shall continue most earnestly to strive
    for their attainment. The cordial cooperation of all classes, of
    all sections of the country and of both races, is required for this
    purpose; and with these blessings assured, and not otherwise, we
    may safely hope to hand down our free institutions of government
    unimpaired to the generations that will succeed us.
</p>
<p>
    Among the other subjects of great and general importance to the people
    of this country, I can not be mistaken, I think, in regarding as
    preeminent the policy and measures which are designed to secure the
    restoration of the currency to that normal and healthful condition in
    which, by the resumption of specie payments, our internal trade
    and foreign commerce may be brought into harmony with the system of
    exchanges which is based upon the precious metals as the intrinsic
    money of the world. In the public judgment that this end should be
    sought and compassed as speedily and securely as the resources of the
    people and the wisdom of their Government can accomplish, there is
    a much greater degree of unanimity than is found to concur in the
    specific measures which will bring the country to this desired end or
    the rapidity of the steps by which it can be safely reached.
</p>
<p>
    Upon a most anxious and deliberate examination, which I have felt it
    my duty to give to the subject, I am but the more confirmed in
    the opinion which I expressed in accepting the nomination for the
    Presidency, and again upon my inauguration, that the policy of
    resumption should be pursued by every suitable means, and that no
    legislation would be wise that should disparage the importance or
    retard the attainment of that result. I have no disposition, and
    certainly no right, to question the sincerity or the intelligence
    of opposing opinions, and would neither conceal nor undervalue the
    considerable difficulties, and even occasional distresses, which may
    attend the progress of the nation toward this primary condition to its
    general and permanent prosperity. I must, however, adhere to my most
    earnest conviction that any wavering in purpose or unsteadiness
    in methods, so far from avoiding or reducing the inconvenience
    inseparable from the transition from an irredeemable to a redeemable
    paper currency, would only tend to increased and prolonged disturbance
    in values, and unless retrieved must end in serious disorder,
    dishonor, and disaster in the financial affairs of the Government and
    of the people.
</p>
<p>
    The mischiefs which I apprehend and urgently deprecate are confined
    to no class of the people, indeed, but seem to me most certainly to
    threaten the industrious masses, whether their occupations are of
    skilled or common labor. To them, it seems to me, it is of prime
    importance that their labor should be compensated in money which is
    itself fixed in exchangeable value by being irrevocably measured by
    the labor necessary to its production. This permanent quality of
    the money of the people is sought for, and can only be gained by
    the resumption of specie payments. The rich, the speculative, the
    operating, the money-dealing classes may not always feel the mischiefs
    of, or may find casual profits in, a variable currency, but the
    misfortunes of such a currency to those who are paid salaries or wages
    are inevitable and remediless.
</p>
<p>
    Closely connected with this general subject of the resumption of
    specie payments is one of subordinate, but still of grave, importance;
    I mean the readjustment of our coinage system by the renewal of
    the silver dollar as an element in our specie currency, endowed by
    legislation with the quality of legal tender to a greater or less
    extent.
</p>
<p>
    As there is no doubt of the power of Congress under the Constitution
    "to coin money and regulate the value thereof," and as this power
    covers the whole range of authority applicable to the metal, the
    rated, value and the legal-tender quality which shall be adopted for
    the coinage, the considerations which should induce or discourage a
    particular measure connected with the coinage, belong clearly to the
    province of legislative discretion and of public expediency. Without
    intruding upon this province of legislation in the least, I have
    yet thought the subject of such critical importance, in the actual
    condition of our affairs, as to present an occasion for the
    exercise of the duty imposed by the Constitution on the President of
    recommending to the consideration of Congress "such measures as he
    shall judge necessary and expedient."
</p>
<p>
    Holding the opinion, as I do, that neither the interests of the
    Government nor of the people of the United States would be promoted by
    disparaging silver as one of the two precious metals which furnish the
    coinage of the world, and that legislation which looks to maintaining
    the volume of intrinsic money to as full a measure of both metals as
    their relative commercial values will permit would be neither unjust
    nor inexpedient, I must ask your indulgence to a brief and definite
    statement of certain essential features in any such legislative
    measure which I feel it my duty to recommend.
</p>
<p>
    I do not propose to enter the debate, represented on both sides by
    such able disputants in Congress and before the people and in the
    press, as to the extent to which the legislation of any one nation
    can control this question, even within its own borders, against the
    unwritten laws of trade or the positive laws of other governments. The
    wisdom of Congress in shaping any particular law that may be presented
    for my approval may wholly supersede the necessity of my entering into
    these considerations, and I willingly avoid either vague or intricate
    inquiries. It is only certain plain and practical traits of such
    legislation that I desire to recommend to your attention.
</p>
<p>
    In any legislation providing for a silver coinage, regulating its
    value, and imparting to it the quality of legal tender, it seems to me
    of great importance that Congress should not lose sight of its action
    as operating in a twofold capacity and in two distinct directions.
    If the United States Government were free from a public debt, its
    legislative dealing with the question of silver coinage would be
    purely sovereign and governmental, under no restraints but those of
    constitutional power and the public good as affected by the proposed
    legislation. But in the actual circumstances of the nation, with a
    vast public debt distributed very widely among our own citizens and
    held in great amounts also abroad, the nature of the silver-coinage
    measure, as affecting this relation of the Government to the holders
    of the public debt, becomes an element, in any proposed legislation,
    of the highest concern. The obligation of the public faith
    transcends all questions of profit or public advantage otherwise.
    Its unquestionable maintenance is the dictate as well of the highest
    expediency as of the most necessary duty, and will ever be carefully
    guarded by Congress and people alike.
</p>
<p>
    The public debt of the United States to the amount of $729,000,000
    bears interest at the rate of 6 per cent, and $708,000,000 at the rate
    of 5 per cent, and the only way in which the country can be relieved
    from the payment of these high rates of interest is by advantageously
    refunding the indebtedness. Whether the debt is ultimately paid in
    gold or in silver coin is of but little moment compared with the
    possible reduction of interest one-third by refunding it at such
    reduced rate. If the United States had the unquestioned right to pay
    its bonds in silver coin, the little benefit from that process would
    be greatly overbalanced by the injurious effect of such payment
    if made or proposed against the honest convictions of the public
    creditors.
</p>
<p>
    All the bonds that have been issued since February 12, 1873, when
    gold became the only unlimited legal-tender metallic currency of the
    country, are justly payable in gold coin or in coin of equal value.
    During the time of these issues the only dollar that could be or was
    received by the Government in exchange for bonds was the gold dollar.
    To require the public creditors to take in repayment any dollar of
    less commercial value would be regarded by them as a repudiation
    of the full obligation assumed. The bonds issued prior to 1873 were
    issued at a time when the gold dollar was the only coin in circulation
    or contemplated by either the Government or the holders of the bonds
    as the coin in which they were to be paid. It is far better to
    pay these bonds in that coin than to seem to take advantage of the
    unforeseen fall in silver bullion to pay in a new issue of silver coin
    thus made so much less valuable. The power of the United States
    to coin money and to regulate the value thereof ought never to be
    exercised for the purpose of enabling the Government to pay its
    obligations in a coin of less value than that contemplated by the
    parties when the bonds were issued. Any attempt to pay the national
    indebtedness in a coinage of less commercial value than the money
    of the world would involve a violation of the public faith and work
    irreparable injury to the public credit.
</p>
<p>
    It was the great merit of the act of March, 1869, in strengthening
    the public credit, that it removed all doubt as to the purpose of the
    United States to pay their bonded debt in coin. That act was accepted
    as a pledge of public faith. The Government has derived great benefit
    from it in the progress thus far made in refunding the public debt at
    low rates of interest. An adherence to the wise and just policy of
    an exact observance of the public faith will enable the Government
    rapidly to reduce the burden of interest on the national debt to an
    amount exceeding $20,000,000 per annum, and effect an aggregate saving
    to the United States of more than $300,000,000 before the bonds can be
    fully paid.
</p>
<p>
    In adapting the new silver coinage to the ordinary uses of currency in
    the everyday transactions of life and prescribing the quality of legal
    tender to be assigned to it, a consideration of the first importance
    should be so to adjust the ratio between the silver and the gold
    coinage, which now constitutes our specie currency, as to accomplish
    the desired end of maintaining the circulation of the two metallic
    currencies and keeping up the volume of the two precious metals as our
    intrinsic money. It is a mixed question, for scientific reasoning
    and historical experience to determine, how far and by what methods a
    practical equilibrium can be maintained which will keep both metals in
    circulation in their appropriate spheres of common use.
</p>
<p>
    An absolute equality of commercial value, free from disturbing
    fluctuations, is hardly attainable, and without it an unlimited
    legal tender for private transactions assigned to both metals would
    irresistibly tend to drive out of circulation the dearer coinage and
    disappoint the principal object proposed by the legislation in view.
    I apprehend, therefore, that the two conditions of a near approach to
    equality of commercial value between the gold and silver coinage of
    the same denomination and of a limitation of the amounts for which the
    silver coinage is to be a legal tender are essential to maintaining
    both in circulation. If these conditions can be successfully observed,
    the issue from the mint of silver dollars would afford material
    assistance to the community in the transition to redeemable paper
    money, and would facilitate the resumption of specie payment and its
    permanent establishment. Without these conditions I fear that only
    mischief and misfortune would flow from a coinage of silver
    dollars with the quality of unlimited legal tender, even in private
    transactions.
</p>
<p>
    Any expectation of temporary ease from an issue of silver coinage to
    pass as a legal tender at a rate materially above its commercial value
    is, I am persuaded, a delusion. Nor can I think that there is any
    substantial distinction between an original issue of silver dollars
    at a nominal value materially above their commercial value and the
    restoration of the silver dollar at a rate which once was, but has
    ceased to be, its commercial value. Certainly the issue of our gold
    coinage, reduced in weight materially below its legal-tender value,
    would not be any the less a present debasement of the coinage by
    reason of its equaling, or even exceeding, in weight a gold
    coinage which at some past time had been commercially equal to the
    legal-tender value assigned to the new issue.
</p>
<p>
    In recommending that the regulation of any silver coinage which may be
    authorized by Congress should observe these conditions of commercial
    value and limited legal tender, I am governed by the feeling that
    every possible increase should be given to the volume of metallic
    money which can be kept in circulation, and thereby every possible aid
    afforded to the people in the process of resuming specie payments. It
    is because of my firm conviction that a disregard of these conditions
    would frustrate the good results which are desired from the proposed
    coinage, and embarrass with new elements of confusion and uncertainty
    the business of the country, that I urge upon your attention these
    considerations.
</p>
<p>
    I respectfully recommend to Congress that in any legislation providing
    for a silver coinage and imparting to it the quality of legal tender
    there be impressed upon the measure a firm provision exempting the
    public debt heretofore issued and now outstanding from payment, either
    of principal or interest, in any coinage of less commercial value than
    the present gold coinage of the country.
</p>
<p>
    The organization of the civil service of the country has for a number
    of years attracted more and more of the public attention. So general
    has become the opinion that the methods of admission to it and
    the conditions of remaining in it are unsound that both the great
    political parties have agreed in the most explicit declarations of the
    necessity of reform and in the most emphatic demands for it. I have
    fully believed these declarations and demands to be the expression of
    a sincere conviction of the intelligent masses of the people upon the
    subject, and that they should be recognized and followed by earnest
    and prompt action on the part of the legislative and executive
    departments of the Government, in pursuance of the purpose indicated.
</p>
<p>
    Before my accession to office I endeavored to have my own views
    distinctly understood, and upon my inauguration my accord with
    the public opinion was stated in terms believed to be plain and
    unambiguous. My experience in the executive duties has strongly
    confirmed the belief in the great advantage the country would find in
    observing strictly the plan of the Constitution, which imposes upon
    the Executive the sole duty and responsibility of the selection of
    those Federal officers who by law are appointed, not elected, and
    which in like manner assigns to the Senate the complete right to
    advise and consent to or to reject the nominations so made, whilst
    the House of Representatives stands as the public censor of the
    performance of official duties, with the prerogative of investigation
    and prosecution in all cases of dereliction. The blemishes and
    imperfections in the civil service may, as I think, be traced in most
    cases to a practical confusion of the duties assigned to the several
    Departments of the Government. My purpose in this respect has been
    to return to the system established by the fundamental law, and to
    do this with the heartiest cooperation and most cordial understanding
    with the Senate and House of Representatives.
</p>
<p>
    The practical difficulties in the selection of numerous officers for
    posts of widely varying responsibilities and duties are acknowledged
    to be very great. No system can be expected to secure absolute freedom
    from mistakes, and the beginning of any attempted change of custom
    is quite likely to be more embarrassed in this respect than any
    subsequent period. It is here that the Constitution seems to me to
    prove its claim to the great wisdom accorded to it. It gives to
    the Executive the assistance of the knowledge and experience of the
    Senate, which, when acting upon nominations as to which they may be
    disinterested and impartial judges, secures as strong a guaranty of
    freedom from errors of importance as is perhaps possible in human
    affairs.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to this, I recognize the public advantage of making all
    nominations, as nearly as possible, impersonal, in the sense of being
    free from mere caprice or favor in the selection; and in those offices
    in which special training is of greatly increased value I believe such
    a rule as to the tenure of office should obtain as may induce men of
    proper qualifications to apply themselves industriously to the task of
    becoming proficients. Bearing these things in mind, I have endeavored
    to reduce the number of changes in subordinate places usually made
    upon the change of the general administration, and shall most heartily
    cooperate with Congress in the better systematizing of such methods
    and rules of admission to the public service and of promotion within
    it as may promise to be most successful in making thorough competency,
    efficiency, and character the decisive tests in these matters.
</p>
<p>
    I ask the renewed attention of Congress to what has already been done
    by the Civil Service Commission, appointed, in pursuance of an act
    of Congress, by my predecessor, to prepare and revise civil-service
    rules. In regard to much of the departmental service, especially at
    Washington, it may be difficult to organize a better system than
    that which has thus been provided, and it is now being used to a
    considerable extent under my direction. The Commission has still a
    legal existence, although for several years no appropriation has been
    made for defraying its expenses. Believing that this Commission
    has rendered valuable service and will be a most useful agency in
    improving the administration of the civil service, I respectfully
    recommend that a suitable appropriation, to be immediately available,
    be made to enable it to continue its labors.
</p>
<p>
    It is my purpose to transmit to Congress as early as practicable a
    report by the chairman of the Commission, and to ask your attention
    to such measures on this subject as in my opinion will further promote
    the improvement of the civil service.
</p>
<p>
    During the past year the United States have continued to maintain
    peaceful relations with foreign powers.
</p>
<p>
    The outbreak of war between Russia and Turkey, though at one time
    attended by grave apprehension as to its effect upon other European
    nations, has had no tendency to disturb the amicable relations
    existing between the United States and each of the two contending
    powers. An attitude of just and impartial neutrality has been
    preserved, and I am gratified to state that in the midst of their
    hostilities both the Russian and the Turkish Governments have shown an
    earnest disposition to adhere to the obligations of all treaties with
    the United States and to give due regard to the rights of American
    citizens.
</p>
<p>
    By the terms of the treaty defining the rights, immunities, and
    privileges of consuls, between Italy and the United States, ratified
    in 1868, either Government may, after the lapse of ten years,
    terminate the existence of the treaty by giving twelve months' notice
    of its intention. The Government of Italy, availing itself of this
    faculty, has now given the required notice, and the treaty will
    accordingly end on the 17th of September, 1878. It is understood,
    however, that the Italian Government wishes to renew it in its general
    scope, desiring only certain modifications in some of its articles.
    In this disposition I concur, and shall hope that no serious obstacles
    may intervene to prevent or delay the negotiation of a satisfactory
    treaty.
</p>
<p>
    Numerous questions in regard to passports, naturalization, and
    exemption from military service have continued to arise in cases of
    emigrants from Germany who have returned to their native country. The
    provisions of the treaty of February 22, 1868, however, have proved to
    be so ample and so judicious that the legation of the United States at
    Berlin has been able to adjust all claims arising under it, not only
    without detriment to the amicable relations existing between the two
    Governments, but, it is believed, without injury or injustice to any
    duly naturalized American citizen. It is desirable that the treaty
    originally made with the North German Union in 1868 should now be
    extended so as to apply equally to all the States of the Empire of
    Germany.
</p>
<p>
    The invitation of the Government of France to participate in the
    Exposition of the Products of Agriculture, Industry, and the Fine
    Arts to be held at Paris during the coming year was submitted for
    your consideration at the extra session. It is not doubted that its
    acceptance by the United States, and a well-selected exhibition of the
    products of American industry on that occasion, will tend to stimulate
    international commerce and emigration, as well as to promote the
    traditional friendship between the two countries.
</p>
<p>
    A question arose some time since as to the proper meaning of the
    extradition articles of the treaty of 1842 between the United States
    and Great Britain. Both Governments, however, are now in accord in
    the belief that the question is not one that should be allowed to
    frustrate the ends of justice or to disturb the friendship between
    the two nations. No serious difficulty has arisen in accomplishing
    the extradition of criminals when necessary. It is probable that all
    points of disagreement will in due time be settled, and, if need be,
    more explicit declarations be made in a new treaty.
</p>
<p>
    The Fishery Commission under Articles XVIII to XXV of the treaty of
    Washington has concluded its session at Halifax. The result of the
    deliberations of the commission, as made public by the commissioners,
    will be communicated to Congress.
</p>
<p>
    A treaty for the protection of trade-marks has been negotiated
    with Great Britain, which has been submitted to the Senate for its
    consideration.
</p>
<p>
    The revolution which recently occurred in Mexico was followed by the
    accession of the successful party to power and the installation of its
    chief, General Porfirio Diaz, in the Presidential office. It has been
    the custom of the United States, when such changes of government have
    heretofore occurred in Mexico, to recognize and enter into official
    relations with the <i>de facto</i> government as soon as it should appear
    to have the approval of the Mexican people and should manifest a
    disposition to adhere to the obligations of treaties and international
    friendship. In the present case such official recognition has been
    deferred by the occurrences on the Rio Grande border, the records
    of which have been already communicated to each House of Congress in
    answer to their respective resolutions of inquiry. Assurances
    have been received that the authorities at the seat of the Mexican
    Government have both the disposition and the power to prevent and
    punish such unlawful invasions and depredations. It is earnestly to be
    hoped that events may prove these assurances to be well founded. The
    best interests of both countries require the maintenance of peace upon
    the border and the development of commerce between the two Republics.
</p>
<p>
    It is gratifying to add that this temporary interruption of official
    relations has not prevented due attention by the representatives of
    the United States in Mexico to the protection of American citizens, so
    far as practicable; nor has it interfered with the prompt payment of
    the amounts due from Mexico to the United States under the treaty of
    July 4, 1868, and the awards of the joint commission. While I do not
    anticipate an interruption of friendly relations with Mexico, yet I
    can not but look with some solicitude upon a continuance of border
    disorders as exposing the two countries to initiations of popular
    feeling and mischances of action which are naturally unfavorable to
    complete amity. Firmly determined that nothing shall be wanting on my
    part to promote a good understanding between the two nations, I yet
    must ask the attention of Congress to the actual occurrences on the
    border, that the lives and property of our citizens may be adequately
    protected and peace preserved.
</p>
<p>
    Another year has passed without bringing to a close the protracted
    contest between the Spanish Government and the insurrection in the
    island of Cuba. While the United States have sedulously abstained from
    any intervention in this contest, it is impossible not to feel that
    it is attended with incidents affecting the rights and interests of
    American citizens. Apart from the effect of the hostilities upon
    trade between the United States and Cuba, their progress is inevitably
    accompanied by complaints, having more or less foundation, of
    searches, arrests, embargoes, and oppressive taxes upon the property
    of American residents, and of unprovoked interference with American
    vessels and commerce. It is due to the Government of Spain to say that
    during the past year it has promptly disavowed and offered reparation
    for any unauthorized acts of unduly zealous subordinates whenever
    such acts have been brought to its attention. Nevertheless, such
    occurrences can not but tend to excite feelings of annoyance,
    suspicion, and resentment, which are greatly to be deprecated, between
    the respective subjects and citizens of two friendly powers.
</p>
<p>
    Much delay (consequent upon accusations of fraud in some of the
    awards) has occurred in respect to the distribution of the limited
    amounts received from Venezuela under the treaty of April 25, 1866,
    applicable to the awards of the joint commission created by that
    treaty. So long as these matters are pending in Congress the Executive
    can not assume either to pass upon the questions presented or to
    distribute the fund received. It is eminently desirable that definite
    legislative action should be taken, either affirming the awards to be
    final or providing some method for reexamination of the claims. Our
    relations with the Republics of Central and South America and with the
    Empire of Brazil have continued without serious change, further than
    the temporary interruption of diplomatic intercourse with Venezuela
    and with Guatemala. Amicable relations have already been fully
    restored with Venezuela, and it is not doubted that all grounds of
    misunderstanding with Guatemala will speedily be removed. From all
    these countries there are favorable indications of a disposition on
    the part of their Governments and people to reciprocate our efforts in
    the direction of increased commercial intercourse.
</p>
<p>
    The Government of the Samoan Islands has sent an envoy, in the person
    of its secretary of state, to invite the Government of the United
    States to recognize and protect their independence, to establish
    commercial relations with their people, and to assist them in their
    steps toward regulated and responsible government. The inhabitants
    of these islands, having made considerable progress in Christian
    civilization and the development of trade, are doubtful of their
    ability to maintain peace and independence without the aid of some
    stronger power. The subject is deemed worthy of respectful attention,
    and the claims upon our assistance by this distant community will be
    carefully considered.
</p>
<p>
    The long commercial depression in the United States has directed
    attention to the subject of the possible increase of our foreign trade
    and the methods for its development, not only with Europe, but with
    other countries, and especially with the States and sovereignties of
    the Western Hemisphere. Instructions from the Department of State
    were issued to the various diplomatic and consular officers of the
    Government, asking them to devote attention to the question of methods
    by which trade between the respective countries of their official
    residence and the United States could be most judiciously fostered.
    In obedience to these instructions, examinations and reports upon this
    subject have been made by many of these officers and transmitted to
    the Department, and the same are submitted to the consideration of
    Congress.
</p>
<p>
    The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the state of the
    finances presents important questions for the action of Congress, upon
    some of which I have already remarked.
</p>
<p>
    The revenues of the Government during the fiscal year ending June 30,
    1877, were $269,000,586.62; the total expenditures for the same period
    were $238,660,008.93, leaving a surplus revenue of $30,340,577.69.
    This has substantially supplied the requirements of the sinking fund
    for that year. The estimated revenues of the current fiscal year are
    $265,500,000, and the estimated expenditures for the same period are
    $232,430,643.72. If these estimates prove to be correct, there will be
    a surplus revenue of $33,069,356.28&mdash;an amount nearly sufficient for
    the sinking fund for that year. The estimated revenues for the next
    fiscal year are $269,250,000. It appears from the report that during
    the last fiscal year the revenues of the Government, compared with the
    previous year, have largely decreased. This decrease, amounting to the
    sum of $18,481,452.54, was mainly in customs duties, caused partly
    by a large falling off of the amount of imported dutiable goods and
    partly by the general fall of prices in the markets of production of
    such articles as pay <i>ad valorem</i> taxes.
</p>
<p>
    While this is felt injuriously in the diminution of the revenue, it
    has been accompanied with a very large increase of exportations. The
    total exports during the last fiscal year, including coin, have
    been $658,637,457, and the imports have been $492,097,540, leaving a
    balance of trade in favor of the United States amounting to the sum of
    $166,539,917, the beneficial effects of which extend to all branches
    of business.
</p>
<p>
    The estimated revenue for the next fiscal year will impose upon
    Congress the duty of strictly limiting appropriations, including the
    requisite sum for the maintenance of the sinking fund, within the
    aggregate estimated receipts.
</p>
<p>
    While the aggregate of taxes should not be increased, amendments
    might be made to the revenue laws that would, without diminishing the
    revenue, relieve the people from unnecessary burdens. A tax on tea and
    coffee is shown by the experience not only of our own country, but
    of other countries, to be easily collected, without loss by
    undervaluation or fraud, and largely borne in the country of
    production. A tax of 10 cents a pound on tea and 2 cents a pound on
    coffee would produce a revenue exceeding $12,000,000, and thus enable
    Congress to repeal a multitude of annoying taxes yielding a revenue
    not exceeding that sum. The internal-revenue system grew out of the
    necessities of the war, and most of the legislation imposing taxes
    upon domestic products under this system has been repealed. By the
    substitution of a tax on tea and coffee all forms of internal taxation
    may be repealed, except that on whisky, spirits, tobacco, and beer.
    Attention is also called to the necessity of enacting more vigorous
    laws for the protection of the revenue and for the punishment of
    frauds and smuggling. This can best be done by judicious provisions
    that will induce the disclosure of attempted fraud by undervaluation
    and smuggling. All revenue laws should be simple in their provisions
    and easily understood. So far as practicable, the rates of taxation
    should be in the form of specific duties, and not <i>ad valorem</i>,
    requiring the judgment of experienced men to ascertain values and
    exposing the revenue to the temptation of fraud.
</p>
<p>
    My attention has been called during the recess of Congress to abuses
    existing in the collection of the customs, and strenuous efforts
    have been made for their correction by Executive orders. The
    recommendations submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury by a
    commission appointed to examine into the collection of customs duties
    at the port of New York contain many suggestions for the modification
    of the customs laws, to which the attention of Congress is invited.
</p>
<p>
    It is matter of congratulation that notwithstanding the severe
    burdens caused by the war the public faith with all creditors has been
    preserved, and that as the result of this policy the public credit has
    continuously advanced and our public securities are regarded with the
    highest favor in the markets of the world. I trust that no act of the
    Government will cast a shadow upon its credit.
</p>
<p>
    The progress of refunding the public debt has been rapid and
    satisfactory. Under the contract existing when I entered upon the
    discharge of the duties of my office, bonds bearing interest at the
    rate of 4-1/2 per cent were being rapidly sold, and within three
    months the aggregate sales of these bonds had reached the sum of
    $200,000,000. With my sanction the Secretary of the Treasury entered
    into a new contract for the sale of 4 per cent bonds, and within
    thirty days after the popular subscription for such bonds was opened
    subscriptions were had amounting to $75,496,550, which were paid for
    within ninety days after the date of subscription. By this process,
    within but little more than one year, the annual interest on the
    public debt was reduced in the sum of $3,775,000.
</p>
<p>
    I recommended that suitable provision be made to enable the people to
    easily convert their savings into Government securities, as the best
    mode in which small savings may be well secured and yield a moderate
    interest. It is an object of public policy to retain among our own
    people the securities of the United States. In this way our country is
    guarded against their sudden return from foreign countries, caused by
    war or other disturbances beyond our limits.
</p>
<p>
    The commerce of the United States with foreign nations, and especially
    the export of domestic productions, has of late years largely
    increased; but the greater portion of this trade is conducted in
    foreign vessels. The importance of enlarging our foreign trade, and
    especially by direct and speedy interchange with countries on this
    continent, can not be overestimated; and it is a matter of great
    moment that our own shipping interest should receive, to the utmost
    practical extent, the benefit of our commerce with other lands. These
    considerations are forcibly urged by all the large commercial cities
    of the country, and public attention is generally and wisely attracted
    to the solution of the problems they present. It is not doubted that
    Congress will take them up in the broadest spirit of liberality
    and respond to the public demand by practical legislation upon this
    important subject.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been
    actively employed during the year, and has rendered very important
    service in suppressing hostilities in the Indian country and in
    preserving peace and protecting life and property in the interior as
    well as along the Mexican border. A long and arduous campaign has been
    prosecuted, with final complete success, against a portion of the Nez
    Percé tribe of Indians. A full account of this campaign will be found
    in the report of the General of the Army. It will be seen that in
    its course several severe battles were fought, in which a number of
    gallant officers and men lost their lives. I join with the Secretary
    of War and the General of the Army in awarding to the officers and men
    employed in the long and toilsome pursuit and in the final capture of
    these Indians the honor and praise which are so justly their due.
</p>
<p>
    The very serious riots which occurred in several of the States in July
    last rendered necessary the employment of a considerable portion of
    the Army to preserve the peace and maintain order. In the States of
    West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Illinois these disturbances
    were so formidable as to defy the local and State authorities, and
    the National Executive was called upon, in the mode provided by the
    Constitution and laws, to furnish military aid. I am gratified to be
    able to state that the troops sent in response to these calls for aid
    in the suppression of domestic violence were able, by the influence
    of their presence in the disturbed regions, to preserve the peace
    and restore order without the use of force. In the discharge of this
    delicate and important duty both officers and men acted with great
    prudence and courage, and for their services deserve the thanks of the
    country.
</p>
<p>
    Disturbances along the Rio Grande in Texas, to which I have already
    referred, have rendered necessary the constant employment of a
    military force in that vicinity. A full report of all recent military
    operations in that quarter has been transmitted to the House of
    Representatives in answer to a resolution of that body, and it will
    therefore not be necessary to enter into details. I regret to say that
    these lawless incursions into our territory by armed bands from the
    Mexican side of the line, for the purpose of robbery, have been of
    frequent occurrence, and in spite of the most vigilant efforts of
    the commander of our forces the marauders have generally succeeded in
    escaping into Mexico with their plunder. In May last I gave orders for
    the exercise of the utmost vigilance on the part of our troops for the
    suppression of these raids and the punishment of the guilty parties,
    as well as the recapture of property stolen by them. General Ord,
    commanding in Texas, was directed to invite the cooperation of the
    Mexican authorities in efforts to this end, and to assure them that I
    was anxious to avoid giving the least offense to Mexico. At the same
    time, he was directed to give notice of my determination to put an
    end to the invasion of our territory by lawless bands intent upon the
    plunder of our peaceful citizens, even if the effectual punishment of
    the outlaws should make the crossing of the border by our troops in
    their pursuit necessary. It is believed that this policy has had
    the effect to check somewhat these depredations, and that with
    a considerable increase of our force upon that frontier and the
    establishment of several additional military posts along the Rio
    Grande, so as more effectually to guard that extensive border, peace
    may be preserved and the lives and property of our citizens in Texas
    fully protected.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the 1st day of July last the Army was, in accordance with
    law, reduced to the maximum of 25,000 enlisted men, being a reduction
    of 2,500 below the force previously authorized. This reduction was
    made, as required by law, entirely from the infantry and artillery
    branches of the service, without any reduction of the cavalry. Under
    the law as it now stands it is necessary that the cavalry regiments
    be recruited to 100 men in each company for service on the Mexican
    and Indian frontiers. The necessary effect of this legislation is to
    reduce the infantry and artillery arms of the service below the number
    required for efficiency, and I concur with the Secretary of War in
    recommending that authority be given to recruit all companies of
    infantry to at least 50 men and all batteries of artillery to at least
    75 men, with the power, in case of emergency, to increase the former
    to 100 and the latter to 122 men each.
</p>
<p>
    I invite your special attention to the following recommendations of
    the Secretary of War:
</p>
<p>
    First. That provision be made for supplying to the Army a more
    abundant and better supply of reading matter.
</p>
<p>
    Second. That early action be taken by Congress looking to a complete
    revision and republication of the Army Regulations.
</p>
<p>
    Third. That section 1258 of the Revised Statutes, limiting the number
    of officers on the retired list, be repealed.
</p>
<p>
    Fourth. That the claims arising under the act of July 4, 1864, for
    supplies taken by the Army during the war, be taken from the offices
    of the Quartermaster and Commissary Generals and transferred to the
    Southern Claims Commission, or some other tribunal having more time
    and better facilities for their prompt investigation and decision than
    are possessed by these officers.
</p>
<p>
    Fifth. That Congress provide for an annuity fund for the families
    of deceased soldiers, as recommended by the Paymaster-General of the
    Army.
</p>

    The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that we have six
    squadrons now engaged in the protection of our foreign commerce
    and other duties pertaining to the naval service. The condition and
    operations of the Department are also shown. The total expenditures
    for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877, were $16,077,974.54. There
    are unpaid claims against the Department chargeable to the last year,
    which are presented to the consideration of Congress by the report of
    the Secretary. The estimates for the fiscal year commencing July 1,
    1878, are $16,233,234.40, exclusive of the sum of $2,314,231
    submitted for new buildings, repairs, and improvements at the several
    navy-yards. The appropriations for the present fiscal year, commencing
    July 1, 1877, are $13,592,932.90. The amount drawn from the Treasury
    from July 1 to November 1, 1877, is $5,343,037.40, of which there is
    estimated to be yet available $1,029,528.30, showing the amount of
    actual expenditure during the first four months of the present fiscal
    year to have been $4,313,509.10.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Postmaster-General contains a full and clear
    statement of the operations and condition of the Post-Office
    Department. The ordinary revenues of the Department for the fiscal
    year ending June 30, 1877, including receipts from the money-order
    business and from official stamps and stamped envelopes, amounted
    to the sum of $27,531,585.26. The additional sum of $7,013,000 was
    realized from appropriations from the general Treasury for various
    purposes, making the receipts from all sources $34,544,885.26. The
    total expenditures during the fiscal year amounted to $33,486,322.44,
    leaving an excess of total receipts over total expenditures of
    $1,058,562.82, and an excess of total expenditures over ordinary
    receipts of $5,954,737.18. Deducting from the total receipts the
    sum of $63,261.84, received from international money orders of the
    preceding fiscal year, and deducting from the total expenditures the
    sum of $1,163,818.20, paid on liabilities incurred in previous fiscal
    years, the expenditures and receipts appertaining to the business of
    the last fiscal year were as follows:
</p>

<table summary="" width="100%"> <tr><td> Expenditures </td><td
align="right">$32,322,504.24</td></tr> <tr><td> Receipts (ordinary, from
money-order business and from official postage stamps) </td><td

expenditures </td><td align="right">4,854,180.82</td></tr> </table>

<p>
    The ordinary revenues of the Post-Office Department for the year
    ending June 30, 1879, are estimated at an increase of 3 per cent over
    those of 1877, making $29,034,098.28, and the expenditures for
    the same year are estimated at $36,427,771, leaving an estimated
    deficiency for the year 1879 of $7,393,672.72. The additional
    legislation recommended by the Postmaster-General for improvements of
    the mail service and to protect the postal revenues from the abuses
    practiced under existing laws is respectfully commended to the careful
    consideration of Congress.

    The report of the Attorney-General contains several suggestions as to
    the administration of justice, to which I invite your attention.
    The pressure of business in the Supreme Court and in certain circuit
    courts of the United States is now such that serious delays, to the
    great injury, and even oppression, of suitors, occur, and a remedy
    should be sought for this condition of affairs. Whether it will be
    found in the plan briefly sketched in the report, of increasing the
    number of judges of the circuit courts, and, by means of this addition
    to the judicial force, of creating an intermediate court of errors and
    appeals, or whether some other mode can be devised for obviating the
    difficulties which now exist, I leave to your mature consideration.

    The present condition of the Indian tribes in the territory of the
    United States and our relations with them are fully set forth in
    the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner
    of Indian Affairs. After a series of most deplorable conflicts&mdash;the
    successful termination of which, while reflecting honor upon the
    brave soldiers who accomplished it, can not lessen our regret at their
    occurrence&mdash;we are now at peace with all the Indian tribes within our
    borders. To preserve that peace by a just and humane policy will be
    the object of my earnest endeavors. Whatever may be said of their
    character and savage propensities, of the difficulties of introducing
    among them the habits of civilized life, and of the obstacles they
    have offered to the progress of settlement and enterprise in certain
    parts of the country, the Indians are certainly entitled to our
    sympathy and to a conscientious respect on our part for their claims
    upon our sense of justice. They were the aboriginal occupants of the
    land we now possess. They have been driven from place to place. The
    purchase money paid to them in some cases for what they called their
    own has still left them poor. In many instances, when they had settled
    down upon land assigned to them by compact and begun to support
    themselves by their own labor, they were rudely jostled off and thrust
    into the wilderness again. Many, if not most, of our Indian wars have
    had their origin in broken promises and acts of injustice upon our
    part, and the advance of the Indians in civilization has been slow
    because the treatment they received did not permit it to be faster
    and more general. We can not expect them to improve and to follow our
    guidance unless we keep faith with them in respecting the rights they
    possess, and unless, instead of depriving them of their opportunities,
    we lend them a helping hand.
</p>
<p>
    I cordially approve the policy regarding the management of Indian
    affairs outlined in the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and
    of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The faithful performance of
    our promises is the first condition of a good understanding with the
    Indians. I can not too urgently recommend to Congress that prompt and
    liberal provision be made for the conscientious fulfillment of all
    engagements entered into by the Government with the Indian tribes.
    To withhold the means necessary for the performance of a promise
    is always false economy, and is apt to prove disastrous in its
    consequences. Especial care is recommended to provide for Indians
    settled on their reservations cattle and agricultural implements, to
    aid them in whatever efforts they may make to support themselves, and
    by the establishment and maintenance of schools to bring them under
    the control of civilized influences. I see no reason why Indians who
    can give satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supported
    their families for a number of years, and who are willing to detach
    themselves from their tribal relations, should not be admitted to the
    benefit of the homestead act and the privileges of citizenship, and
    I recommend the passage of a law to that effect. It will be an act
    of justice as well as a measure of encouragement. Earnest efforts
    are being made to purify the Indian service, so that every dollar
    appropriated by Congress shall redound to the benefit of the Indians,
    as intended. Those efforts will have my firm support. With an improved
    service and every possible encouragement held out to the Indians
    to better their condition and to elevate themselves in the scale of
    civilization, we may hope to accomplish at the same time a good work
    for them and for ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    I invite the attention of Congress to the importance of the statements
    and suggestions made by the Secretary of the Interior concerning the
    depredations committed on the timber lands of the United States and
    the necessity for the preservation of forests. It is believed that
    the measures taken in pursuance of existing laws to arrest those
    depredations will be entirely successful if Congress, by an
    appropriation for that purpose, renders their continued enforcement
    possible. The experience of other nations teaches us that a country
    can not be stripped of its forests with impunity, and we shall
    expose ourselves to the gravest consequences unless the wasteful
    and improvident manner in which the forests in the United States
    are destroyed be effectually checked. I earnestly recommend that
    the measures suggested by the Secretary of the Interior for the
    suppression of depredations on the public timber lands of the United
    States, for the selling of timber from the public lands, and for the
    preservation of forests be embodied in a law, and that, considering
    the urgent necessity of enabling the people of certain States and
    Territories to purchase timber from the public lands in a legal
    manner, which at present they can not do, such a law be passed without
    unavoidable delay. I would also call the attention of Congress to
    the statements made by the Secretary of the Interior concerning the
    disposition that might be made of the desert lands, not irrigable,
    west of the one hundredth meridian. These lands are practically
    unsalable under existing laws, and the suggestion is worthy of
    consideration that a system of leasehold tenure would make them
    a source of profit to the United States, while at the same time
    legalizing the business of cattle raising which is at present carried
    on upon them.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture contains the gratifying
    announcement of the extraordinary success which has rewarded the
    agricultural industry of the country for the past year. With the fair
    prices which obtain for the products of the soil, especially for the
    surplus which our people have to export, we may confidently turn to
    this as the most important of all our resources for the revival of the
    depressed industries of the country. The report shows our agricultural
    progress during the year, and contains a statement of the work done
    by this Department for the advancement of agricultural industry, upon
    which the prosperity of our people so largely depends. Matters of
    information are included of great interest to all who seek, by the
    experience of others, to improve their own methods of cultivation.
    The efforts of the Department to increase the production of important
    articles of consumption will, it is hoped, improve the demand for
    labor and advance the business of the country, and eventually result
    in saving some of the many millions that are now annually paid to
    foreign nations for sugar and other staple products which habitual use
    has made necessary in our domestic everyday life.

    The board on behalf of the United States Executive Departments at the
    International Exhibition of 1876 has concluded its labors. The final
    report of the board was transmitted to Congress by the President
    near the close of the last session. As these papers are understood to
    contain interesting and valuable information, and will constitute
    the only report emanating from the Government on the subject of the
    exhibition, I invite attention to the matter and recommend that the
    report be published for general information.
</p>
<p>
    Congress is empowered by the Constitution with the authority of
    exclusive legislation over the District of Columbia, in which the seat
    of Government of the nation is located. The interests of the District,
    having no direct representation in Congress, are entitled to especial
    consideration and care at the hands of the General Government. The
    capital of the United States belongs to the nation, and it is natural
    that the American people should take pride in the seat of their
    National Government and desire it to be an ornament to the country.
    Much has been done to render it healthful, convenient, and attractive,
    but much remains to be done, which its permanent inhabitants are not
    able and ought not to be expected to do. To impose upon them a large
    proportion of the cost required for public improvements, which are
    in a great measure planned and executed for the convenience of the
    Government and of the many thousands of visitors from all parts of
    the country who temporarily reside at the capital of the nation, is an
    evident injustice. Special attention is asked by the Commissioners of
    the District in their report, which is herewith transmitted, to the
    importance of a permanent adjustment by Congress of the financial
    relations between the United States and the District, involving
    the regular annual contribution by the United States of its just
    proportion of the expenses of the District government and of the
    outlay for all needed public improvements, and such measure of
    relief from the burden of taxation now resting upon the people of the
    District as in the wisdom of Congress may be deemed just.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Commissioners shows that the affairs of the District
    are in a condition as satisfactory as could be expected in view of the
    heavy burden of debt resting upon it and its very limited means for
    necessary expenses.
</p>
<p>
    The debt of the District is as follows:
</p>

<table summary="" width="100%"> <tr><td> Old funded debt </td><td
align="right">$8,379,691.96</td></tr> <tr><td> 3.65 bonds, guaranteed by
the United States </td><td align="right">13,743,250.00</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td align="right"><hr class="full"></td></tr> <tr><td>
Total bonded debt </td><td align="right">22,122,941.96</td></tr>
<tr><td> To which should be added certain outstanding claims, as
explained in the report of the Commissioners </td><td

class="full"></td></tr> <tr><td> Making the total debt of the District
</td><td align="right">23,310,146.48</td></tr> </table>

<p>
    The Commissioners also ask attention to the importance of the
    improvement of the Potomac River and the reclamation of the marshes
    bordering the city of Washington, and their views upon this subject
    are concurred in by the members of the board of health, whose report
    is also herewith transmitted. Both the commercial and sanitary
    interests of the District will be greatly promoted, I doubt not,
    by this improvement.
</p>
<p>
    Your attention is invited to the suggestion of the Commissioners and
    of the board of health for the organization of a board of charities,
    to have supervision and control of the disbursement of all moneys for
    charitable purposes from the District treasury. I desire also to ask
    your especial attention to the need of adding to the efficiency of the
    public schools of the District by supplemental aid from the National
    Treasury. This is especially just, since so large a number of those
    attending these schools are children of employees of the Government.
    I earnestly commend to your care the interests of the people of
    the District, who are so intimately associated with the Government
    establishments, and to whose enterprise the good order and
    attractiveness of the capital are largely due; and I ask your
    attention to the request of the Commissioners for legislation in
    behalf of the interests intrusted to their care. The appropriations
    asked for the care of the reservations belonging to the Government
    within the city, by the Commissioner of Public Buildings and Grounds,
    are also commended to your favorable consideration.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the joint commission created by the act approved 2d of
    August, 1876, entitled "An act providing for the completion of the
    Washington Monument," is also herewith transmitted, with accompanying
    documents. The board of engineer officers detailed to examine the
    monument, in compliance with the second section of the act, have
    reported that the foundation is insufficient. No authority exists for
    making the expenditure necessary to secure its stability. I therefore
    recommend that the commission be authorized to expend such portion of
    the sum appropriated by the act as may be necessary for the purpose.
    The present unfinished condition of the monument, begun so long ago,
    is a reproach to the nation. It can not be doubted that the patriotic
    sense of the country will warmly respond to such prompt provision
    as may be made for its completion at an early day, and I urge upon
    Congress the propriety and necessity of immediate legislation for this
    purpose.
</p>
<p>
    The wisdom of legislation upon the part of Congress, in aid of the
    States, for the education of the whole people in those branches of
    study which are taught in the common schools of the country is no
    longer a question. The intelligent judgment of the country goes still
    further, regarding it as also both constitutional and expedient for
    the General Government to extend to technical and higher education,
    such aid as is deemed essential to the general welfare and to our due
    prominence among the enlightened and cultured nations of the world.
    The ultimate settlement of all questions of the future, whether of
    administration or finance or of true nationality of sentiment, depends
    upon the virtue and intelligence of the people. It is vain to hope
    for the success of a free government without the means of insuring
    the intelligence of those who are the source of power. No less than
    one-seventh of the entire voting population of our country are yet
    unable to read and write.
</p>
<p>
    It is encouraging to observe, in connection with the growth of
    fraternal feeling in those States in which slavery formerly existed,
    evidences of increasing interest in universal education, and I shall
    be glad to give my approval to any appropriate measures which may be
    enacted by Congress for the purpose of supplementing with national aid
    the local systems of education in those States and in all the States;
    and, having already invited your attention to the needs of the
    District of Columbia with respect to its public-school system, I here
    add that I believe it desirable, not so much with reference to the
    local wants of the District, but to the great and lasting benefit
    of the entire country, that this system should be crowned with a
    university in all respects in keeping with the national capital, and
    thereby realize the cherished hopes of Washington on this subject.
</p>
<p>
    I also earnestly commend the request of the Regents of the
    Smithsonian Institution that an adequate appropriation be made for
    the establishment and conduct of a national museum under their
    supervision.
</p>
<p>
    The question of providing for the preservation and growth of the
    Library of Congress is also one of national importance. As the
    depository of all copyright publications and records, this library has
    outgrown the provisions for its accommodation; and the erection, on
    such site as the judgment of Congress may approve, of a fireproof
    library building, to preserve the treasures and enlarge the usefulness
    of this valuable collection, is recommended. I recommend also such
    legislation as will render available and efficient for the purposes
    of instruction, so far as is consistent with the public service, the
    cabinets or museums of invention, of surgery, of education, and
    of agriculture, and other collections the property of the National
    Government.
</p>
<p>
    The capital of the nation should be something more than a mere
    political center. We should avail ourselves of all the opportunities
    which Providence has here placed at our command to promote the general
    intelligence of the people and increase the conditions most favorable
    to the success and perpetuity of our institutions.

<h2>
    VETO MESSAGES.
</h2>
<p class="r">
    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>February 28, 1878</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    After a very careful consideration of the House bill No. 1093,
    entitled "An act to authorize the coinage of the standard silver
    dollar and to restore its legal-tender character," I feel compelled
    to return it to the House of Representatives, in which it originated,
    with my objections to its passage.
</p>
<p>
    Holding the opinion, which I expressed in my annual message, that
    "neither the interests of the Government nor of the people of the
    United States would be promoted by disparaging silver as one of the
    two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world, and that
    legislation which looks to maintaining the volume of intrinsic money
    to as full a measure of both metals as their relative commercial
    values will permit would be neither unjust nor inexpedient," it has
    been my earnest desire to concur with Congress in the adoption of such
    measures to increase the silver coinage of the country as would not
    impair the obligation of contracts, either public or private, nor
    injuriously affect the public credit. It is only upon the conviction
    that this bill does not meet these essential requirements that I feel
    it my duty to withhold from it my approval.
</p>
<p>
    My present official duty as to this bill permits only an attention to
    the specific objections to its passage which seem to me so important
    as to justify me in asking from the wisdom and duty of Congress that
    further consideration of the bill for which the Constitution has in
    such cases provided.
</p>
<p>
    The bill provides for the coinage of silver dollars of the weight of
    412-1/2 grains each, of standard silver, to be a legal tender at their
    nominal value for all debts and dues, public and private, except where
    otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract. It is well known that
    the market value of that number of grains of standard silver during
    the past year has been from 90 to 92 cents as compared with the
    standard gold dollar. Thus the silver dollar authorized by this bill
    is worth 8 to 10 per cent less than it purports to be worth, and
    is made a legal tender for debts contracted when the law did not
    recognize such coins as lawful money.
</p>
<p>
    The right to pay duties in silver or in certificates for silver
    deposits will, when they are issued in sufficient amount to circulate,
    put an end to the receipt of revenue in gold, and thus compel the
    payment of silver for both the principal and interest of the public
    debt. One billion one hundred and forty-three million four hundred
    and ninety-three thousand four hundred dollars of the bonded debt now
    outstanding was issued prior to February, 1873, when the silver dollar
    was unknown in circulation in this country, and was only a convenient
    form of silver bullion for exportation; $583,440,350 of the funded
    debt has been issued since February, 1873, when gold alone was the
    coin for which the bonds were sold, and gold alone was the coin in
    which both parties to the contract understood that the bonds would
    be paid. These bonds entered into the markets of the world. They were
    paid for in gold when silver had greatly depreciated, and when no one
    would have bought them if it had been understood that they would be
    paid in silver. The sum of $225,000,000 of these bonds has been sold
    during my Administration for gold coin, and the United States received
    the benefit of these sales by a reduction of the rate of interest to
    4 per cent. During the progress of these sales a doubt was suggested
    as to the coin in which payment of these bonds would be made. The
    public announcement was thereupon authorized that it was "not to be
    anticipated that any future legislation of Congress or any action
    of any department of the Government would sanction or tolerate the
    redemption of the principal of these bonds or the payment of the
    interest thereon in coin of less value than the coin authorized by law
    at the time of the issue of the bonds, being the coin exacted by the
    Government in exchange for the same." In view of these facts it will
    be justly regarded as a grave breach of the public faith to undertake
    to pay these bonds, principal or interest, in silver coin worth in the
    market less than the coin received for them.
</p>
<p>
    It is said that the silver dollar made a legal tender by this bill
    will under its operation be equivalent in value to the gold dollar.
    Many supporters of the bill believe this, and would not justify an
    attempt to pay debts, either public or private, in coin of inferior
    value to the money of the world. The capital defect of the bill
    is that it contains no provision protecting from its operation
    preexisting debts in case the coinage which it creates shall continue
    to be of less value than that which was the sole legal tender when
    they were contracted. If it is now proposed, for the purpose of taking
    advantage of the depreciation of silver in the payment of debts, to
    coin and make a legal tender a silver dollar of less commercial value
    than any dollar, whether of gold or paper, which is now lawful money
    in this country, such measure, it will hardly be questioned, will,
    in the judgment of mankind, be an act of bad faith. As to all debts
    heretofore contracted, the silver dollar should be made a legal tender
    only at its market value. The standard of value should not be changed
    without the consent of both parties to the contract. National promises
    should be kept with unflinching fidelity. There is no power to compel
    a nation to pay its just debts. Its credit depends on its honor. The
    nation owes what it has led or allowed its creditors to expect. I can
    not approve a bill which in my judgment authorizes the violation of
    sacred obligations. The obligation of the public faith transcends
    all questions of profit or public advantage. Its unquestionable
    maintenance is the dictate as well of the highest expediency as of
    the most necessary duty, and should ever be carefully guarded by the
    Executive, by Congress, and by the people.
</p>
<p>
    It is my firm conviction that if the country is to be benefited by a
    silver coinage it can be done only by the issue of silver dollars of
    full value, which will defraud no man. A currency worth less than it
    purports to be worth will in the end defraud not only creditors, but
    all who are engaged in legitimate business, and none more surely than
    those who are dependent on their daily labor for their daily bread.

    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>March 6, 1878.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the House of Representatives:</i>
</p>
<p>
    I return herewith House bill No. 3072, entitled "An act to authorize
    a special term of the circuit court of the United States for the
    southern district of Mississippi to be held at Scranton, in Jackson
    County," with the following objections to its becoming a law:
</p>
<p>
    The act provides that a special term of the circuit court of the
    United States for the southern district of Mississippi shall be held
    at Scranton, in Jackson County, Miss., to begin on the second Monday
    in March, 1878, and directs the clerk of said court to "cause notice
    of said special term of said court to be published in a newspaper in
    Jackson, Miss., and also in a newspaper in Scranton, at least ten days
    before the beginning thereof."
</p>
<p>
    The act can not be executed, inasmuch as there is not sufficient time
    to give the notice of the holding of the special term which Congress
    thought proper to require.
</p>
<p>
    The number of suits to be tried at the special term in which the
    United States is interested is forty-nine, and the amount involved
    exceeds $200,000. The Government can not prepare for trial at said
    special term, because no fund appropriated by Congress can be made
    available for that purpose. If, therefore, the Government is compelled
    to go to trial at the special term provided for by this bill, the
    United States must be defeated for want of time and means to make
    preparation for the proper vindication of its rights.
</p>
<p>
    The bill is therefore returned for the further consideration of
    Congress.

<p>
    Whereas it is provided in the laws of the United States that whenever,
    by reason of unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages of
    persons, or rebellion against the authority of the Government of the
    United States, it shall become impracticable, in the judgment of the
    President, to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings
    the laws of the United States within any State or Territory, it shall
    be lawful for the President to call forth the militia of any or all
    the States and to employ such parts of the land and naval forces of
    the United States as he may deem necessary to enforce the faithful
    execution of the laws of the United States or to suppress such
    rebellion, in whatever State or Territory thereof the laws of the
    United States may be forcibly opposed or the execution thereof
    forcibly obstructed; and
</p>
<p>
    Whereas it has been made to appear to me that, by reason of unlawful
    combinations and assemblages of persons in arms, it has become
    impracticable to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial
    proceedings the laws of the United States within the Territory of New
    Mexico, and especially within Lincoln County therein, and that the
    laws of the United States have been therein forcibly opposed and the
    execution thereof forcibly resisted; and
</p>
<p>
    Whereas the laws of the United States require that whenever it may be
    necessary, in the judgment of the President, to use the military force
    for the purpose of enforcing the faithful execution of the laws of
    the United States, he shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such
    insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes
    within a limited time:
</p>
<p>
    Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United

    and especially of the Territory of New Mexico, against aiding,
    countenancing, abetting, or taking part in any such unlawful
    proceedings; and I do hereby warn all persons engaged in or connected

<p>
    The recurrence of that season at which it is the habit of our people
    to make devout and public confession of their constant dependence upon
    the divine favor for all the good gifts of life and happiness and
    of public peace and prosperity exhibits in the record of the year
    abundant reasons for our gratitude and thanksgiving.
</p>
<p>
    Exuberant harvests, productive mines, ample crops of the staples of
    trade and manufactures, have enriched the country.
</p>
<p>
    The resources thus furnished to our reviving industry and expanding
    commerce are hastening the day when discords and distresses through
    the length and breadth of the land will, under the continued favor
    of Providence, have given way to confidence and energy and assured
    prosperity.
</p>
<p>
    Peace with all nations has been maintained unbroken, domestic
    tranquillity has prevailed, and the institutions of liberty and
    justice which the wisdom and virtue of our fathers established remain
    the glory and defense of their children.
</p>
<p>
    The general prevalence of the blessings of health through our wide
    land has made more conspicuous the sufferings and sorrows which the
    dark shadow of pestilence has cast upon a portion of our people. This
    heavy affliction even the Divine Ruler has tempered to the suffering
    communities in the universal sympathy and succor which have flowed to
    their relief, and the whole nation may rejoice in the unity of spirit
    in our people by which they cheerfully share one another's burdens.
</p>
<p>
    Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United
    States, do appoint Thursday, the 28th day of November next, as a day
    of national thanksgiving and prayer; and I earnestly recommend that,
    withdrawing themselves from secular cares and labors, the people of
    the United States do meet together on that day in their respective
    places of worship, there to give thanks and praise to Almighty God for
    His mercies and to devoutly beseech their continuance.

    the Revised Statutes of the United States, and in execution of the
    same, you are hereby empowered and directed to take possession of the
    steamer <i>Estelle</i>, now or lately lying at Bristol, in Rhode Island,

<h2>
    SECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.
</h2>
<p class="r">
    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>December 2, 1878</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    Our heartfelt gratitude is due to the Divine Being who holds in His
    hands the destinies of nations for the continued bestowal during the
    last year of countless blessings upon our country.
</p>
<p>
    We are at peace with all other nations. Our public credit has greatly
    improved, and is perhaps now stronger than ever before. Abundant
    harvests have rewarded the labors of those who till the soil, our
    manufacturing industries are reviving, and it is believed that general
    prosperity, which has been so long anxiously looked for, is at last
    within our reach.
</p>
<p>
    The enjoyment of health by our people generally has, however, been
    interrupted during the past season by the prevalence of a fatal
    pestilence (the yellow fever) in some portions of the Southern States,
    creating an emergency which called for prompt and extraordinary
    measures of relief. The disease appeared as an epidemic at New Orleans
    and at other places on the Lower Mississippi soon after midsummer.
    It was rapidly spread by fugitives from the infected cities and
    towns, and did not disappear until early in November. The States of
    Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee have suffered severely. About
    100,000 cases are believed to have occurred, of which about 20,000,
    according to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It is impossible
    to estimate with any approach to accuracy the loss to the country
    occasioned by this epidemic. It is to be reckoned by the hundred
    millions of dollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted
    excited the deepest sympathy in all parts of the Union. Physicians and
    nurses hastened from every quarter to the assistance of the afflicted
    communities. Voluntary contributions of money and supplies, in every
    needed form, were speedily and generously furnished. The Government
    was able to respond in some measure to the call for help, by providing
    tents, medicines, and food for the sick and destitute, the requisite
    directions for the purpose being given in the confident expectation
    that this action of the Executive would receive the sanction of
    Congress. About 1,800 tents, and rations of the value of about
    $25,000, were sent to cities and towns which applied for them,
    full details of which will be furnished to Congress by the proper
    Department.
</p>
<p>
    The fearful spread of this pestilence has awakened a very general
    public sentiment in favor of national sanitary administration, which
    shall not only control quarantine, but have the sanitary supervision
    of internal commerce in times of epidemics, and hold an advisory
    relation to the State and municipal health authorities, with power
    to deal with whatever endangers the public health, and which the
    municipal and State authorities are unable to regulate. The national
    quarantine act approved April 29, 1878, which was passed too late in
    the last session of Congress to provide the means for carrying it into
    practical operation during the past season, is a step in the direction
    here indicated. In view of the necessity for the most effective
    measures, by quarantine and otherwise, for the protection of our
    seaports and the country generally from this and other epidemics,
    it is recommended that Congress give to the whole subject early and
    careful consideration.
</p>
<p>
    The permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection
    of all citizens in every civil and political right continues to be of
    paramount interest with the great body of our people. Every step
    in this direction is welcomed with public approval, and every
    interruption of steady and uniform progress to the desired
    consummation awakens general uneasiness and widespread condemnation.
    The recent Congressional elections have furnished a direct and
    trustworthy test of the advance thus far made in the practical
    establishment of the right of suffrage secured by the Constitution to
    the liberated race in the Southern States. All disturbing influences,
    real or imaginary, had been removed from all of these States.
</p>
<p>
    The three constitutional amendments which conferred freedom and
    equality of civil and political rights upon the colored people of the
    South were adopted by the concurrent action of the great body of good
    citizens who maintained the authority of the National Government and
    the integrity and perpetuity of the Union at such a cost of treasure
    and life, as a wise and necessary embodiment in the organic law of the
    just results of the war. The people of the former slaveholding States
    accepted these results, and gave in every practicable form assurances
    that the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments, and laws
    passed in pursuance thereof, should in good faith be enforced, rigidly
    and impartially, in letter and spirit, to the end that the humblest
    citizen, without distinction of race or color, should under them
    receive full and equal protection in person and property and in
    political rights and privileges. By these constitutional amendments
    the southern section of the Union obtained a large increase of
    political power in Congress and in the electoral college, and the
    country justly expected that elections would proceed, as to
    the enfranchised race, upon the same circumstances of legal and
    constitutional freedom and protection which obtained in all the other
    States of the Union. The friends of law and order looked forward to
    the conduct of these elections as offering to the general judgment of
    the country an important opportunity to measure the degree in which
    the right of suffrage could be exercised by the colored people and
    would be respected by their fellow-citizens; but a more general
    enjoyment of freedom of suffrage by the colored people and a more just
    and generous protection of that freedom by the communities of which
    they form a part were generally anticipated than the record of the
    elections discloses. In some of those States in which the colored
    people have been unable to make their opinions felt in the elections
    the result is mainly due to influences not easily measured or remedied
    by legal protection; but in the States of Louisiana and South Carolina
    at large, and in some particular Congressional districts outside
    of those States, the records of the elections seem to compel the
    conclusion that the rights of the colored voters have been overridden
    and their participation in the elections not permitted to be either
    general or free.
</p>
<p>
    It will be for the Congress for which these elections were held to
    make such examinations into their conduct as may be appropriate to
    determine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. In
    the meanwhile it becomes the duty of the executive and judicial
    departments of the Government, each in its province, to inquire into
    and punish violations of the laws of the United States which have
    occurred. I can but repeat what I said in this connection in my last
    message, that whatever authority rests with me to this end I shall not
    hesitate to put forth; and I am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal
    to the legislatures, the courts, the executive authorities, and the
    people of the States where these wrongs have been perpetrated to
    give their assistance toward bringing to justice the offenders and
    preventing a repetition of the crimes. No means within my power will
    be spared to obtain a full and fair investigation of the alleged
    crimes and to secure the conviction and just punishment of the guilty.
</p>
<p>
    It is to be observed that the principal appropriation made for the
    Department of Justice at the last session contained the following
    clause:
</p>
<p class="q">
  And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the
  enforcement of the act approved February 28, 1871, entitled
  "An act to amend an act approved May 31, 1870, entitled 'An
  act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States
  to vote in the several States of this Union, and for other
  purposes,'" or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary
  thereto.
</p>
<p>
    It is the opinion of the Attorney-General that the expenses of these
    proceedings will largely exceed the amount which was thus provided,
    and I rely confidently upon Congress to make adequate appropriations
    to enable the executive department to enforce the laws.
</p>
<p>
    I respectfully urge upon your attention that the Congressional
    elections, in every district, in a very important sense, are justly a
    matter of political interest and concern throughout the whole country.
    Each State, every political party, is entitled to the share of power
    which is conferred by the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the
    right of every citizen possessing the qualifications prescribed by
    law to cast one unintimidated ballot and to have his ballot honestly
    counted. So long as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of
    this right are common and equal, practically as well as formally,
    submission to the results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and
    cheerfully, and all the departments of Government will feel the
    true vigor of the popular will thus expressed. No temporary or
    administrative interests of Government, however urgent or weighty,
    will ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary
    rights of citizenship. They understand that the protection of liberty
    requires the maintenance in full vigor of the manly methods of free
    speech, free press, and free suffrage, and will sustain the full
    authority of Government to enforce the laws which are framed to
    preserve these inestimable rights. The material progress and welfare
    of the States depend on the protection afforded to their citizens.
    There can be no peace without such protection, no prosperity without
    peace, and the whole country is deeply interested in the growth and
    prosperity of all its parts.
</p>
<p>
    While the country has not yet reached complete unity of feeling
    and reciprocal confidence between the communities so lately and so
    seriously estranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies
    are in that direction, and with increasing force. The power of public
    opinion will override all political prejudices and all sectional or
    State attachments in demanding that all over our wide territory the
    name and character of citizen of the United States shall mean one and
    the same thing and carry with them unchallenged security and respect.
</p>
<p>
    Our relations with other countries continue peaceful. Our neutrality
    in contests between foreign powers has been maintained and respected.
</p>
<p>
    The Universal Exposition held at Paris during the past summer has been
    attended by large numbers of our citizens. The brief period allowed
    for the preparation and arrangement of the contributions of our
    citizens to this great exposition was well employed in energetic and
    judicious efforts to overcome this disadvantage. These efforts, led
    and directed by the commissioner-general, were remarkably successful,
    and the exhibition of the products of American industry was creditable
    and gratifying in scope and character. The reports of the United
    States commissioners, giving its results in detail, will be duly laid
    before you. Our participation in this international competition for
    the favor and the trade of the world may be expected to produce useful
    and important results&mdash;in promoting intercourse, friendship, and
    commerce with other nations.
</p>
<p>
    In accordance with the provisions of the act of February 28, 1878,
    three commissioners were appointed to an international conference on
    the subject of adopting a common ratio between gold and silver, for
    the purpose of establishing internationally the use of bimetallic
    money and securing fixity of relative value between those metals.
</p>
<p>
    Invitations were addressed to the various governments which had
    expressed a willingness to participate in its deliberations. The
    conference held its meetings in Paris in August last. The report
    of the commissioners, herewith submitted, will show its results.
    No common ratio between gold and silver could be agreed upon by the
    conference. The general conclusion was reached that it is necessary to
    maintain in the world the monetary functions of silver as well as of
    gold, leaving the selection of the use of one or the other of these
    two metals, or of both, to be made by each state.
</p>
<p>
    Congress having appropriated at its last session the sum of $5,500,000
    to pay the award of the joint commission at Halifax, if, after
    correspondence with the British Government on the subject of the
    conformity of the award to the requirements of the treaty and to
    the terms of the question thereby submitted to the commission, the
    President shall deem it his duty to make the payment, communications
    upon these points were addressed to the British Government through
    the legation of the United States at London. Failing to obtain the
    concurrence of the British Government in the views of this Government
    respecting the award, I have deemed it my duty to tender the sum named
    within the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a notice of the
    grounds of the payment and a protest against any other construction
    of the same. The correspondence upon this subject will be laid before
    you.
</p>
<p>
    The Spanish Government has officially announced the termination of
    the insurrection in Cuba and the restoration of peace throughout that
    island. Confident expectations are expressed of a revival of trade
    and prosperity, which it is earnestly hoped may prove well founded.
    Numerous claims of American citizens for relief for injuries
    or restoration of property have been among the incidents of the
    long-continued hostilities. Some of these claims are in process of
    adjustment by Spain, and the others are promised early and careful
    consideration.
</p>
<p>
    The treaty made with Italy in regard to reciprocal consular privileges
    has been duly ratified and proclaimed.
</p>
<p>
    No questions of grave importance have arisen with any other of the
    European powers.
</p>
<p>
    The Japanese Government has been desirous of a revision of such parts
    of its treaties with foreign powers as relate to commerce, and it is
    understood has addressed to each of the treaty powers a request to
    open negotiations with that view. The United States Government has
    been inclined to regard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictions
    upon trade with Japan are found injurious to that people can not but
    affect injuriously nations holding commercial intercourse with them.
    Japan, after a long period of seclusion, has within the past few years
    made rapid strides in the path of enlightenment and progress, and, not
    unreasonably, is looking forward to the time when her relations with
    the nations of Europe and America shall be assimilated to those which
    they hold with each other. A treaty looking to this end has been made,
    which will be submitted for the consideration of the Senate.
</p>
<p>
    After an interval of several years the Chinese Government has again
    sent envoys to the United States. They have been received, and a
    permanent legation is now established here by that Government. It is
    not doubted that this step will be of advantage to both nations in
    promoting friendly relations and removing causes of difference.
</p>
<p>
    The treaty with the Samoan Islands, having been duly ratified and
    accepted on the part of both Governments, is now in operation, and a
    survey and soundings of the harbor of Pago-Pago have been made by a
    naval vessel of the United States, with a view of its occupation as
    a naval station if found desirable to the service.
</p>
<p>
    Since the resumption of diplomatic relations with Mexico
    correspondence has been opened and still continues between the two
    Governments upon the various questions which at one time seemed to
    endanger their relations. While no formal agreement has been reached
    as to the troubles on the border, much has been done to repress and
    diminish them. The effective force of United States troops on the Rio
    Grande, by a strict and faithful compliance with instructions, has
    done much to remove the sources of dispute, and it is now understood
    that a like force of Mexican troops on the other side of the river is
    also making an energetic movement against the marauding Indian tribes.
    This Government looks with the greatest satisfaction upon every
    evidence of strength in the national authority of Mexico, and upon
    every effort put forth to prevent or to punish incursions upon our
    territory. Reluctant to assume any action or attitude in the control
    of these incursions by military movements across the border not
    imperatively demanded for the protection of the lives and property
    of our own citizens, I shall take the earliest opportunity consistent
    with the proper discharge of this plain duty to recognize the ability
    of the Mexican Government to restrain effectively violations of
    our territory. It is proposed to hold next year an international
    exhibition in Mexico, and it is believed that the display of the
    agricultural and manufacturing products of the two nations will tend
    to better understanding and increased commercial intercourse between
    their people.
</p>
<p>
    With Brazil and the Republics of Central and South America some
    steps have been taken toward the development of closer commercial
    intercourse. Diplomatic relations have been resumed with Colombia and
    with Bolivia. A boundary question between the Argentine Republic and
    Paraguay has been submitted by those Governments for arbitration
    to the President of the United States, and I have, after careful
    examination, given a decision upon it.
</p>
<p>
    A naval expedition up the Amazon and Madeira rivers has brought back
    information valuable both for scientific and commercial purposes. A
    like expedition is about visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian
    Ocean. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers in relation
    to the development of our foreign commerce have furnished many facts
    that have proved of public interest and have stimulated to practical
    exertion the enterprise of our people.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Secretary of the Treasury furnishes a detailed
    statement of the operations of that Department of the Government and
    of the condition of the public finances.
</p>
<p>
    The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June
    30, 1878, were $257,763,878.70; the ordinary expenditures for the same
    period were $236,964,326.80, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of
    $20,799,551.90. The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June
    30, 1879, actual and estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for
    the first quarter, commencing July 1, 1878, $73,389,743.43;
    estimated receipts for the remaining three quarters of the year,
    $191,110,256.57; total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual
    and estimated, $264,500,000. The expenditures for the same period will
    be, actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July
    1, 1878, actual expenditures, $73,344,573.27; and for the remaining
    three quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at
    $166,755,426.73, making the total expenditures $240,100,000, and
    leaving an estimated surplus revenue for the year ending June 30,
    1879, of $24,400,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year,
    ending June 30, 1880, estimated according to existing laws, will be
    $264,500,000, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same
    period will be $236,320,412.68, leaving a surplus of $28,179,587.32
    for that year.
</p>
<p>
    In the foregoing statements of expenditures, actual and estimated,
    no amount is allowed for the sinking fund provided for by the act
    approved February 25, 1862, which requires that 1 per cent of the
    entire debt of the United States shall be purchased or paid within
    each fiscal year, to be set apart as a sinking fund. There has been,
    however, a substantial compliance with the conditions of the law. By
    its terms the public debt should have been reduced between 1862
    and the close of the last fiscal year $518,361,806.28; the
    actual reduction of the ascertained debt in that period has been
    $720,644,739.61, being in excess of the reduction required by the
    sinking fund act $202,282,933.33.
</p>
<p>
    The amount of the public debt, less cash in the Treasury, November 1,
    1878, was $2,024,200,083.18, a reduction since the same date last year
    of $23,150,617.39.
</p>
<p>
    The progress made during the last year in refunding the public debt at
    lower rates of interest is very gratifying. The amount of 4 per cent
    bonds sold during the present year prior to November 23, 1878, is
    $100,270,900, and 6 per cent bonds, commonly known as five-twenties,
    to an equal amount, have been or will be redeemed as calls mature.
</p>
<p>
    It has been the policy of the Department to place the 4 per cent bonds
    within easy reach of every citizen who desires to invest his savings,
    whether small or great, in these securities. The Secretary of the
    Treasury recommends that the law be so modified that small sums may
    be invested, and that through the post-offices or other agents of the
    Government the freest opportunity may be given in all parts of the
    country for such investments.
</p>
<p>
    The best mode suggested is that the Department be authorized to issue
    certificates of deposit, of the denomination of $10, bearing interest
    at the rate of 3.65 per cent per annum and convertible at any time
    within one year after their issue into the 4 per cent bonds authorized
    by the refunding act, and to be issued only in exchange for United
    States notes sent to the Treasury by mail or otherwise. Such a
    provision of law, supported by suitable regulations, would enable any
    person readily, without cost or risk, to convert his money into an
    interest-bearing security of the United States, and the money so
    received could be applied to the redemption of 6 per cent bonds.
</p>
<p>
    The coinage of gold during the last fiscal year was $52,798,980. The
    coinage of silver dollars under the act passed February 28, 1878,
    amounted on the 23d of November, 1878, to $19,814,550, of which amount
    $4,984,947 are in circulation, and the balance, $14,829,603, is still
    in the possession of the Government.
</p>
<p>
    With views unchanged with regard to the act under which the coinage of
    silver proceeds, it has been the purpose of the Secretary faithfully
    to execute the law and to afford a fair trial to the measure.
</p>
<p>
    In the present financial condition of the country I am persuaded that
    the welfare of legitimate business and industry of every description
    will be best promoted by abstaining from all attempts to make radical
    changes in the existing financial legislation. Let it be understood
    that during the coming year the business of the country will be
    undisturbed by governmental interference with the laws affecting it,
    and we may confidently expect that the resumption of specie payments,
    which will take place at the appointed time, will be successfully and
    easily maintained, and that it will be followed by a healthful and
    enduring revival of business prosperity.
</p>
<p>
    Let the healing influence of time, the inherent energies of our
    people, and the boundless resources of our country have a fair
    opportunity, and relief from present difficulties will surely follow.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been well
    and economically supplied; that our small force has been actively
    employed and has faithfully performed all the service required of it.
    The morale of the Army has improved and the number of desertions has
    materially decreased during the year.
</p>
<p>
    The Secretary recommends&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    1. That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lieutenant Henry
    H. Benner, Eighteenth Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever
    while in command of the steamer <i>J.M. Chambers</i>, sent with supplies
    for the relief of sufferers in the South from that disease.
</p>
<p>
    2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for the benefit of the
    heirs of deceased officers, as suggested by the Paymaster-General.
</p>
<p>
    3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for the publication of the
    records of the War of the Rebellion, now being prepared for that
    purpose.
</p>
<p>
    4. The increase of the extra per diem of soldier teachers employed in
    post schools, and liberal appropriations for the erection of buildings
    for schools and libraries at the different posts.
</p>
<p>
    5. The repeal or amendment of the act of June 18, 1878, forbidding the
    use of the Army "as a <i>posse comitatus</i>, or otherwise, for the
    purpose of executing the laws, except in such cases and under such
    circumstances as such employment of said force may be expressly
    authorized by the Constitution or by act of Congress."
</p>
<p>
    6. The passage of a joint resolution of Congress legalizing the issues
    of rations, tents, and medicines which were made for the relief of
    sufferers from yellow fever.
</p>
<p>
    7. That provision be made for the erection of a fireproof building for
    the preservation of certain valuable records, now constantly exposed
    to destruction by fire.

    These recommendations are all commended to your favorable
    consideration.

    The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that the Navy
    has improved during the last fiscal year. Work has been done on
    seventy-five vessels, ten of which have been thoroughly repaired
    and made ready for sea. Two others are in rapid progress toward
    completion. The total expenditures of the year, including the
    amount appropriated for the deficiencies of the previous year, were
    $17,468,392.65. The actual expenses chargeable to the year, exclusive
    of these deficiencies, were $13,306,914.09, or $767,199.18 less than
    those of the previous year, and $4,928,677.74 less than the expenses
    including the deficiencies. The estimates for the fiscal year ending
    June 30, 1880, are $14,562,381.45, exceeding the appropriations of
    the present year only $33,949.75, which excess is occasioned by the
    demands of the Naval Academy and the Marine Corps, as explained in the
    Secretary's report. The appropriations for the present fiscal year are
    $14,528,431.70, which, in the opinion of the Secretary, will be ample
    for all the current expenses of the Department during the year. The
    amount drawn from the Treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1878, is
    $4,740,544.14, of which $70,980.75 has been refunded, leaving as the
    expenditure for that period $4,669,563.39, or $520,899.24 less than
    the corresponding period of the last fiscal year.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Postmaster-General embraces a detailed statement of
    the operations of the Post-Office Department. The expenditures of
    that Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were
    $34,165,084.49. The receipts, including sales of stamps, money-order
    business, and official stamps, were $29,277,516.95. The sum of
    $290,436.90, included in the foregoing statement of expenditures, is
    chargeable to preceding years, so that the actual expenditures for the
    fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, are $33,874,647.59. The amount drawn
    from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to the revenues of
    the Department, was $5,307,652.82. The expenditures for the fiscal
    year ending June 30, 1880, are estimated at $36,571,900 and the
    receipts from all sources at $30,664,023.90, leaving a deficiency to
    be appropriated out of the Treasury of $5,907,876.10. The report calls
    attention to the fact that the compensation of postmasters and of
    railroads for carrying the mail is regulated by law, and that the
    failure of Congress to appropriate the amounts required for these
    purposes does not relieve the Government of responsibility, but
    necessarily increases the deficiency bills which Congress will be
    called upon to pass.
</p>
<p>
    In providing for the postal service the following questions are
    presented: Should Congress annually appropriate a sum for its expenses
    largely in excess of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be
    established as will make the Department self-sustaining? Should the
    postal service be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which
    does not pay its way? Should the number of post routes be diminished?
    Should other methods be adopted which will increase the revenues or
    diminish the expenses of the postal service?
</p>
<p>
    The International Postal Congress which met at Paris May 1, 1878, and
    continued in session until June 4 of the same year, was composed of
    delegates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It
    adopted a new convention (to take the place of the treaty concluded
    at Berne October 9, 1874), which goes into effect on the 1st of April,
    1879, between the countries whose delegates have signed it. It was
    ratified and approved, by and with the consent of the President,
    August 13, 1878. A synopsis of this Universal Postal Convention will
    be found in the report of the Postmaster-General, and the full text
    in the appendix thereto. In its origin the Postal Union comprised
    twenty-three countries, having a population of 350,000,000 people.
    On the 1st of April next it will comprise forty-three countries and
    colonies, with a population of more than 650,000,000 people, and will
    soon, by the accession of the few remaining countries and colonies
    which maintain organized postal services, constitute in fact as well
    as in name, as its new title indicates, a universal union, regulating,
    upon a uniform basis of cheap postage rates, the postal intercourse
    between all civilized nations.
</p>
<p>
    Some embarrassment has arisen out of the conflict between the customs
    laws of this country and the provisions of the Postal Convention in
    regard to the transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this
    country by mail. It is hoped that Congress will be able to devise some
    means of reconciling the difficulties which have thus been created, so
    as to do justice to all parties involved.
</p>
<p>
    The business of the Supreme Court and of the courts in many of the
    circuits has increased to such an extent during the past year that
    additional legislation is imperative to relieve and prevent the
    delay of justice and possible oppression to suitors which is thus
    occasioned. The encumbered condition of these dockets is presented
    anew in the report of the Attorney-General, and the remedy suggested
    is earnestly urged for Congressional action. The creation of
    additional circuit judges, as proposed, would afford a complete
    remedy, and would involve an expense, at the present rate of salaries,
    of not more than $60,000 a year.
</p>
<p>
    The annual reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the
    Commissioner of Indian Affairs present an elaborate account of the
    present condition of the Indian tribes and of that branch of the
    public service which ministers to their interests. While the conduct
    of the Indians generally has been orderly and their relations with
    their neighbors friendly and peaceable, two local disturbances have
    occurred, which were deplorable in their character, but remained,
    happily, confined to a comparatively small number of Indians. The
    discontent among the Bannocks, which led first to some acts of
    violence on the part of some members of the tribe and finally to the
    outbreak, appears to have been caused by an insufficiency of food
    on the reservation, and this insufficiency to have been owing to the
    inadequacy of the appropriations made by Congress to the wants of the
    Indians at a time when the Indians were prevented from supplying the
    deficiency by hunting. After an arduous pursuit by the troops of
    the United States, and several engagements, the hostile Indians
    were reduced to subjection, and the larger part of them surrendered
    themselves as prisoners. In this connection I desire to call attention
    to the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that
    a sufficient fund be placed at the disposal of the Executive, to be
    used, with proper accountability, at discretion, in sudden emergencies
    of the Indian service.
</p>
<p>
    The other case of disturbance was that of a band of Northern
    Cheyennes, who suddenly left their reservation in the Indian Territory
    and marched rapidly through the States of Kansas and Nebraska in the
    direction of their old hunting grounds, committing murders and other
    crimes on their way. From documents accompanying the report of the
    Secretary of the Interior it appears that this disorderly band was as
    fully supplied with the necessaries of life as the 4,700 other Indians
    who remained quietly on the reservation, and that the disturbance
    was caused by men of a restless and mischievous disposition among the
    Indians themselves. Almost the whole of this band have surrendered to
    the military authorities; and it is a gratifying fact that when some
    of them had taken refuge in the camp of the Red Cloud Sioux, with whom
    they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners
    and readily gave them up to the officers of the United States, thus
    giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors to the
    contrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly shown ever since the
    wishes they expressed at the council of September, 1877, had been
    complied with.
</p>
<p>
    Both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of War unite
    in the recommendation that provision be made by Congress for the
    organization of a corps of mounted "Indian auxiliaries," to be under
    the control of the Army and to be used for the purpose of keeping the
    Indians on their reservations and preventing or repressing disturbance
    on their part. I earnestly concur in this recommendation. It is
    believed that the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry,
    receiving a moderate pay from the Government, would considerably
    weaken the restless element among the Indians by withdrawing from it
    a number of young men and giving them congenial employment under
    the Government, it being a matter of experience that Indians in our
    service almost without exception are faithful in the performance of
    the duties assigned to them. Such an organization would materially
    aid the Army in the accomplishment of a task for which its numerical
    strength is sometimes found insufficient.
</p>
<p>
    But while the employment of force for the prevention or repression
    of Indian troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation
    should be made to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humane
    and civilizing agencies for the ultimate solution of what is called
    the Indian problem. It may be very difficult and require much
    patient effort to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian to the
    restraints of civilized life, but experience shows that it is not
    impossible. Many of the tribes which are now quiet and orderly and
    self-supporting were once as savage as any that at present roam
    over the plains or in the mountains of the far West, and were then
    considered inaccessible to civilizing influences. It may be impossible
    to raise them fully up to the level of the white population of the
    United States; but we should not forget that they are the aborigines
    of the country, and called the soil their own on which our people have
    grown rich, powerful, and happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty to
    help them in attaining at least that degree of civilization which they
    may be able to reach. It is not only our duty, it is also our interest
    to do so. Indians who have become agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel
    an interest in property, will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and
    disturbing element. It is also a well-authenticated fact that Indians
    are apt to be peaceable and quiet when their children are at school,
    and I am gratified to know, from the expressions of Indians themselves
    and from many concurring reports, that there is a steadily increasing
    desire, even among Indians belonging to comparatively wild tribes, to
    have their children educated. I invite attention to the reports of
    the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs
    touching the experiment recently inaugurated, in taking fifty Indian
    children, boys and girls, from different tribes, to the Hampton Normal
    Agricultural Institute in Virginia, where they are to receive an
    elementary English education and training in agriculture and other
    useful works, to be returned to their tribes, after the completed
    course, as interpreters, instructors, and examples. It is reported
    that the officer charged with the selection of those children might
    have had thousands of young Indians sent with him had it been possible
    to make provision for them. I agree with the Secretary of the
    Interior in saying that "the result of this interesting experiment,
    if favorable, may be destined to become an important factor in the
    advancement of civilization among the Indians."
</p>
<p>
    The question whether a change in the control of the Indian service
    should be made was at the last session of Congress referred to a
    committee for inquiry and report. Without desiring to anticipate
    that report, I venture to express the hope that in the decision of so
    important a question the views expressed above may not be lost sight
    of, and that the decision, whatever it may be, will arrest further
    agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce
    a disturbing effect upon the service, as well as on the Indians
    themselves.
</p>
<p>
    In the enrollment of the bill making appropriations for sundry civil
    expenses, at the last session of Congress, that portion which provided
    for the continuation of the Hot Springs Commission was omitted. As
    the commission had completed the work of taking testimony on the many
    conflicting claims, the suspension of their labors, before determining
    the rights of claimants, threatened for a time to embarrass the
    interests, not only of the Government, but also of a large number
    of the citizens of Hot Springs, who were waiting for final action on
    their claims before beginning contemplated improvements. In order
    to prevent serious difficulties, which were apprehended, and at
    the solicitation of many leading citizens of Hot Springs and others
    interested in the welfare of the town, the Secretary of the Interior
    was authorized to request the late commissioners to take charge of
    the records of their proceedings and to perform such work as could
    properly be done by them under such circumstances to facilitate the
    future adjudication of the claims at an early day and to preserve
    the status of the claimants until their rights should be finally
    determined. The late commissioners complied with that request, and
    report that the testimony in all the cases has been written out,
    examined, briefed, and so arranged as to facilitate an early
    settlement when authorized by law. It is recommended that the
    requisite authority be given at as early a day in the session
    as possible, and that a fair compensation be allowed the late
    commissioners for the expense incurred and the labor performed
    by them since the 25th of June last.
</p>
<p>
    I invite the attention of Congress to the recommendations made by
    the Secretary of the Interior with regard to the preservation of the
    timber on the public lands of the United States. The protection of
    the public property is one of the first duties of the Government. The
    Department of the Interior should therefore be enabled by sufficient
    appropriations to enforce the laws in that respect. But this matter
    appears still more important as a question of public economy. The
    rapid destruction of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest
    consequences, especially in the mountainous districts, where the rocky
    slopes, once denuded of their trees, will remain so forever. There
    the injury, once done, can not be repaired. I fully concur with
    the Secretary of the Interior in the opinion that for this reason
    legislation touching the public timber in the mountainous States and
    Territories of the West should be especially well considered, and
    that existing laws in which the destruction of the forests is not
    sufficiently guarded against should be speedily modified. A general
    law concerning this important subject appears to me to be a matter of
    urgent public necessity.
</p>
<p>
    From the organization of the Government the importance of encouraging
    by all possible means the increase of our agricultural productions
    has been acknowledged and urged upon the attention of Congress and the
    people as the surest and readiest means of increasing our substantial
    and enduring prosperity.
</p>
<p>
    The words of Washington are as applicable to-day as when, in his
    eighth annual message, he said:
</p>
<p class="q">
  It will not be doubted that, with reference either to
  individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary
  importance. In proportion as nations advance in population
  and other circumstances of maturity this truth becomes more
  apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and
  more an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting
  it grow up, supported by the public purse; and to what object
  can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means
  which have been employed to this end none have been attended
  with greater success than the establishment of boards
  (composed of proper characters) charged with collecting and
  diffusing information, and enabled by premiums and small
  pecuniary aids to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery
  and improvement. This species of establishment contributes
  doubly to the increase of improvement, by stimulating to
  enterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a common center
  the results everywhere of individual skill and observation
  and spreading them thence over the whole nation. Experience
  accordingly hath shewn that they are very cheap instruments of
  immense national benefits.
</p>
<p>
    The preponderance of the agricultural over any other interest in the
    United States entitles it to all the consideration claimed for it by
    Washington. About one-half of the population of the United States is
    engaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural products of the
    United States for the year 1878 is estimated at $3,000,000,000. The
    exports of agricultural products for the year 1877, as appears from
    the report of the Bureau of Statistics, were $524,000,000. The great
    extent of our country, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables
    us to produce within our own borders and by our own labor not only the
    necessaries, but most of the luxuries, that are consumed in civilized
    countries. Yet, notwithstanding our advantages of soil, climate, and
    intercommunication, it appears from the statistical statements in the
    report of the Commissioner of Agriculture that we import annually from
    foreign lands many millions of dollars worth of agricultural products
    which could be raised in our own country.
</p>
<p>
    Numerous questions arise in the practice of advanced agriculture
    which can only be answered by experiments, often costly and sometimes
    fruitless, which are beyond the means of private individuals and are
    a just and proper charge on the whole nation for the benefit of the
    nation. It is good policy, especially in times of depression
    and uncertainty in other business pursuits, with a vast area of
    uncultivated, and hence unproductive, territory, wisely opened to
    homestead settlement, to encourage by every proper and legitimate
    means the occupation and tillage of the soil. The efforts of
    the Department of Agriculture to stimulate old and introduce new
    agricultural industries, to improve the quality and increase the
    quantity of our products, to determine the value of old or establish
    the importance of new methods of culture, are worthy of your careful
    and favorable consideration, and assistance by such appropriations of
    money and enlargement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by the
    present favorable conditions for the growth and rapid development of
    this important interest.
</p>
<p>
    The abuse of animals in transit is widely attracting public attention.
    A national convention of societies specially interested in the subject
    has recently met at Baltimore, and the facts developed, both in regard
    to cruelties to animals and the effect of such cruelties upon the
    public health, would seem to demand the careful consideration of
    Congress and the enactment of more efficient laws for the prevention
    of these abuses.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Education shows
    very gratifying progress throughout the country in all the interests
    committed to the care of this important office. The report is
    especially encouraging with respect to the extension of the advantages
    of the common-school system in sections of the country where the
    general enjoyment of the privilege of free schools is not yet
    attained.
</p>
<p>
    To education more than to any other agency we are to look as the
    resource for the advancement of the people in the requisite knowledge
    and appreciation of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and
    I desire to repeat the suggestion contained in my former message in
    behalf of the enactment of appropriate measures by Congress for
    the purpose of supplementing with national aid the local systems of
    education in the several States.
</p>
<p>
    Adequate accommodations for the great library, which is overgrowing
    the capacity of the rooms now occupied at the Capitol, should be
    provided without further delay. This invaluable collection of books,
    manuscripts, and illustrative art has grown to such proportions, in
    connection with the copyright system of the country, as to demand the
    prompt and careful attention of Congress to save it from injury in its
    present crowded and insufficient quarters. As this library is national
    in its character, and must from the nature of the case increase even
    more rapidly in the future than in the past, it can not be doubted
    that the people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and
    to enlarge its usefulness.
</p>
<p>
    The appeal of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for the means
    to organize, exhibit, and make available for the public benefit the
    articles now stored away belonging to the National Museum I heartily
    recommend to your favorable consideration.
</p>
<p>
    The attention of Congress is again invited to the condition of
    the river front of the city of Washington. It is a matter of vital
    importance to the health of the residents of the national capital,
    both temporary and permanent, that the lowlands in front of the city,
    now subject to tidal overflow, should be reclaimed. In their present
    condition these flats obstruct the drainage of the city and are a
    dangerous source of malarial poison. The reclamation will improve the
    navigation of the river by restricting, and consequently deepening,
    its channel, and is also of importance when considered in connection
    with the extension of the public ground and the enlargement of the
    park west and south of the Washington Monument. The report of the
    board of survey, heretofore ordered by act of Congress, on
    the improvement of the harbor of Washington and Georgetown, is
    respectfully commended to consideration.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia presents
    a detailed statement of the affairs of the District.
</p>
<p>
    The relative expenditures by the United States and the District for
    local purposes is contrasted, showing that the expenditures by the
    people of the District greatly exceed those of the General Government.
    The exhibit is made in connection with estimates for the requisite
    repair of the defective pavements and sewers of the city, which is
    a work of immediate necessity; and in the same connection a plan is
    presented for the permanent funding of the outstanding securities of
    the District.
</p>
<p>
    The benevolent, reformatory, and penal institutions of the District
    are all entitled to the favorable attention of Congress. The Reform
    School needs additional buildings and teachers. Appropriations which
    will place all of these institutions in a condition to become models
    of usefulness and beneficence will be regarded by the country as
    liberality wisely bestowed.
</p>
<p>
    The Commissioners, with evident justice, request attention to the
    discrimination made by Congress against the District in the donation
    of land for the support of the public schools, and ask that the same
    liberality that has been shown to the inhabitants of the various
    States and Territories of the United States may be extended to the
    District of Columbia.
</p>
<p>
    The Commissioners also invite attention to the damage inflicted upon
    public and private interests by the present location of the depots and
    switching tracks of the several railroads entering the city, and ask
    for legislation looking to their removal. The recommendations and
    suggestions contained in the report will, I trust, receive the careful
    consideration of Congress.
</p>
<p>
    Sufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed since the reorganization
    of the government of the District under the recent legislation
    of Congress for the expression of a confident opinion as to its
    successful operation, but the practical results already attained are
    so satisfactory that the friends of the new government may well
    urge upon Congress the wisdom of its continuance, without essential
    modification, until by actual experience its advantages and defects
    may be more fully ascertained.

    may have been received by the Departments concerning postal and
    commercial intercourse between the United States and South American
    countries, together with any recommendations desirable to be submitted
    of measures to be adopted for facilitating and improving such
    intercourse," I transmit herewith reports from the Secretary of State
    and the Postmaster-General, with accompanying papers.
</p>
<p>
    The external commerce of the United States has for many years been
    the subject of solicitude because of the outward drain of the precious
    metals it has caused. For fully twenty years previous to 1877 the
    shipment of gold was constant and heavy&mdash;so heavy during the entire
    period of the suspension of specie payments as to preclude the hope of
    resumption safely during its continuance. In 1876, however, vigorous
    efforts were made by enterprising citizens of the country, and have
    since been continued, to extend our general commerce with foreign
    lands, especially in manufactured articles, and these efforts have
    been attended with very marked success.
</p>
<p>
    The importation of manufactured goods was at the same time reduced in
    an equal degree, and the result has been an extraordinary reversal
    of the conditions so long prevailing and a complete cessation of
    the outward drain of gold. The official statement of the values
    represented in foreign commerce will show the unprecedented magnitude
    to which the movement has attained, and the protection thus secured to
    the public interests at the time when commercial security has become
    indispensable.
</p>
<p>
    The agencies through which this change has been effected must be
    maintained and strengthened if the future is to be made secure. A
    return to excessive imports or to a material decline in export trade
    would render possible a return to the former condition of adverse
    balances, with the inevitable outward drain of gold as a necessary
    consequence. Every element of aid to the introduction of the
    products of our soil and manufactures into new markets should be made
    available. At present such is the favor in which many of the products
    of the United States are held that they obtain a remunerative
    distribution, notwithstanding positive differences of cost resulting
    from our defective shipping and the imperfection of our arrangements
    in every respect, in comparison with those of our competitors, for
    conducting trade with foreign markets.
</p>
<p>
    If we have equal commercial facilities, we need not fear competition
    anywhere.
</p>
<p>
    The laws have now directed a resumption of financial equality with
    other nations, and have ordered a return to the basis of coin values.
    It is of the greatest importance that the commercial condition now
    fortunately attained shall be made permanent, and that our rapidly
    increasing export trade shall not be allowed to suffer for want of the
    ordinary means of communication with other countries.
</p>
<p>
    The accompanying reports contain a valuable and instructive summary of
    information with respect to our commercial interests in South America,
    where an inviting field for the enterprise of our people is presented.
    They are transmitted with the assurance that any measures that may be
    enacted in furtherance of these important interests will meet with my
    cordial approval.

<p>
    I transmit herewith a letter of the Secretary of the Treasury, in
    relation to the suspension of the late collector and naval officer of
    the port of New York, with accompanying documents.
</p>
<p>
    In addition thereto I respectfully submit the following observations:
</p>
<p>
    The custom-house in New York collects more than two-thirds of all the
    customs revenues of the Government. Its administration is a matter not
    of local interest merely, but is of great importance to the people
    of the whole country. For a long period of time it has been used to
    manage and control political affairs.
</p>
<p>
    The officers suspended by me are and for several years have been
    engaged in the active personal management of the party politics of
    the city and State of New York. The duties of the offices held by
    them have been regarded as of subordinate importance to their partisan
    work. Their offices have been conducted as part of the political
    machinery under their control. They have made the custom-house a
    center of partisan political management. The custom-house should be
    a business office. It should be conducted on business principles.
    General James, the postmaster of New York City, writing on this
    subject, says:
</p>
<p>
    The post-office is a business institution, and should be run as such.
    It is my deliberate judgment that I and my subordinates can do more
    for the party of our choice by giving the people of this city a
    good and efficient postal service than by controlling primaries or
    dictating nominations.
</p>
<p>
    The New York custom-house should be placed on the same footing
    with the New York post-office. But under the suspended officers the
    custom-house would be one of the principal political agencies in the
    State of New York. To change this, they profess to believe, would be,
    in the language of Mr. Cornell in his response, "to surrender their
    personal and political rights."
</p>
<p>
    Convinced that the people of New York and of the country generally
    wish the New York custom-house to be administered solely with a view
    to the public interest, it is my purpose to do all in my power
    to introduce into this great office the reforms which the country
    desires.
</p>
<p>
    With my information of the facts in the case, and with a deep sense
    of the responsible obligation imposed upon me by the Constitution "to
    take care that the laws be faithfully executed," I regard it as
    my plain duty to suspend the officers in question and to make the
    nominations now before the Senate, in order that this important office
    may be honestly and efficiently administered.

<h2>
    VETO MESSAGE.
</h2>
<p class="r">
    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>March 1, 1879.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    After a very careful consideration of House bill 2423, entitled "An
    act to restrict the immigration of Chinese to the United States,"
    I herewith return it to the House of Representatives, in which it
    originated, with my objections to its passage.
</p>
<p>
    The bill, as it was sent to the Senate from the House of
    Representatives, was confined in its provisions to the object named
    in its title, which is that of "An act to restrict the immigration of
    Chinese to the United States." The only means adopted to secure the
    proposed object was the limitation on the number of Chinese passengers
    which might be brought to this country by any one vessel to fifteen;
    and as this number was not fixed in any proportion to the size
    or tonnage of the vessel or by any consideration of the safety or
    accommodation of these passengers, the simple purpose and effect of
    the enactment were to repress this immigration to an extent falling
    but little short of its absolute exclusion.
</p>
<p>
    The bill, as amended in the Senate and now presented to me, includes
    an independent and additional provision which aims at and in terms
    requires the abrogation by this Government of Articles V and VI of the
    treaty with China commonly called the Burlingame treaty, through the
    action of the Executive enjoined by this provision of the act.
</p>
<p>
    The Burlingame treaty, of which the ratifications were exchanged at
    Peking November 23, 1869, recites as the occasion and motive of its
    negotiation by the two Governments that "since the conclusion of the
    treaty between the United States of America and the Ta Tsing Empire
    (China) of the 18th of June, 1858, circumstances have arisen showing
    the necessity of additional articles thereto," and proceeds to
    an agreement as to said additional articles. These negotiations,
    therefore, ending by the signature of the additional articles July
    28, 1868, had for their object the completion of our treaty rights
    and obligations toward the Government of China by the incorporation
    of these new articles as thenceforth parts of the principal treaty
    to which they are made supplemental. Upon the settled rules of
    interpretation applicable to such supplemental negotiations the text
    of the principal treaty and of these "additional articles thereto"
    constitute one treaty from the conclusion of the new negotiations, in
    all parts of equal and concurrent force and obligation between the
    two Governments, and to all intents and purposes as if embraced in one
    instrument.
</p>
<p>
    The principal treaty, of which the ratifications were exchanged August
    16, 1859, recites that "the United States of America and the Ta Tsing
    Empire, desiring to maintain firm, lasting, and sincere friendship,
    have resolved to renew, in a manner clear and positive, by means of a
    treaty or general convention of peace, amity, and commerce, the rules
    which shall in future be mutually observed in the intercourse of their
    respective countries," and proceeds in its thirty articles to lay out
    a careful and comprehensive system for the commercial relations of our
    people with China. The main substance of all the provisions of this
    treaty is to define and secure the rights of our people in respect
    of access to, residence and protection in, and trade with China. The
    actual provisions in our favor in these respects were framed to be,
    and have been found to be, adequate and appropriate to the interests
    of our commerce, and by the concluding article we receive the
    important guaranty that&mdash;
</p>
<p class="q">
  Should at any time the Ta Tsing Empire grant to any nation, or the
  merchants or citizens of any nation, any right, privilege, or favor,
  connected either with navigation, commerce, political or other
  intercourse, which is not conferred by this treaty, such right,
  privilege, and favor shall at once freely inure to the benefit of
  the United States, its public officers, merchants, and citizens.
</p>
<p>
    Against this body of stipulations in our favor and this permanent
    engagement of equality in respect of all future concessions to foreign
    nations the general promise of permanent peace and good offices on
    our part seems to be the only equivalent. For this the first article
    undertakes as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  There shall be, as there have always been, peace and friendship
  between the United States of America and the Ta Tsing Empire, and
  between their people respectively. They shall not insult or oppress
  each other for any trifling cause, so as to produce an estrangement
  between them; and if any other nation should act unjustly or
  oppressively, the United States will exert their good offices, on
  being informed of the case, to bring about an amicable arrangement
  of the question, thus showing their friendly feelings.
</p>
<p>
    At the date of the negotiation of this treaty our Pacific possessions
    had attracted a considerable Chinese emigration, and the advantages
    and the inconveniences felt or feared therefrom had become more or
    less manifest; but they dictated no stipulations on the subject to be
    incorporated in the treaty. The year 1868 was marked by the striking
    event of a spontaneous embassy from the Chinese Empire, headed by
    an American citizen, Anson Burlingame, who had relinquished his
    diplomatic representation of his own country in China to assume that
    of the Chinese Empire to the United States and the European nations.
    By this time the facts of the Chinese immigration and its nature and
    influences, present and prospective, had become more noticeable and
    were more observed by the population immediately affected and by this
    Government. The principal feature of the Burlingame treaty was its
    attention to and its treatment of the Chinese immigration and the
    Chinese as forming, or as they should form, a part of our population.
    Up to this time our uncovenanted hospitality to immigration, our
    fearless liberality of citizenship, our equal and comprehensive
    justice to all inhabitants, whether they abjured their foreign
    nationality or not, our civil freedom, and our religious toleration
    had made all comers welcome, and under these protections the Chinese
    in considerable numbers had made their lodgment upon our soil.
</p>
<p>
    The Burlingame treaty undertakes to deal with this situation, and its
    fifth and sixth articles embrace its most important provisions in this
    regard and the main stipulations in which the Chinese Government has
    secured an obligatory protection of its subjects within our territory.
    They read as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  ART. V. The United States of America and the Emperor of China
  cordially recognize the inherent and inalienable right of man to
  change his home and allegiance, and also the mutual advantage of
  the free migration and emigration of their citizens and subjects
  respectively from the one country to the other for purposes of
  curiosity, of trade, or as permanent residents. The high contracting
  parties therefore join in reprobating any other than an entirely
  voluntary emigration for these purposes. They consequently agree to
  pass laws making it a penal offense for a citizen of the United States
  or Chinese subjects to take Chinese subjects either to the United
  States or to any other foreign country, or for a Chinese subject or
  citizen of the United States to take citizens of the United States
  to China or to any other foreign country, without their free and
  voluntary consent, respectively.
</p><p class="q">
  ART. VI. Citizens of the United States visiting or residing in China
  shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, or exemptions in respect
  to travel or residence as may there be enjoyed by the citizens or
  subjects of the most favored nation, and, reciprocally, Chinese
  subjects visiting or residing in the United States shall enjoy the
  same privileges, immunities, and exemptions in respect to travel or
  residence as may there be enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the
  most favored nation. But nothing herein contained shall be held to
  confer naturalization upon citizens of the United States in China,
  nor upon the subjects of China in the United States.
</p>
<p>
    An examination of these two articles in the light of the experience
    then influential in suggesting their "necessity" will show that the
    fifth article was framed in hostility to what seemed the principal
    mischief to be guarded against, to wit, the introduction of Chinese
    laborers by methods which should have the character of a forced and
    servile importation, and not of a voluntary emigration of freemen
    seeking our shores upon motives and in a manner consonant with the
    system of our institutions and approved by the experience of the
    nation. Unquestionably the adhesion of the Government of China to
    these liberal principles of freedom in emigration, with which we were
    so familiar and with which we were so well satisfied, was a great
    advance toward opening that Empire to our civilization and religion,
    and gave promise in the future of greater and greater practical
    results in the diffusion throughout that great population of our arts
    and industries, our manufactures, our material improvements, and the
    sentiments of government and religion which seem to us so important to
    the welfare of mankind. The first clause of this article secures this
    acceptance by China of the American doctrines of free migration to and
    fro among the peoples and races of the earth.
</p>
<p>
    The second clause, however, in its reprobation of "any other than an
    entirely voluntary emigration" by both the high contracting parties,
    and in the reciprocal obligations whereby we secured the solemn and
    unqualified engagement on the part of the Government of China "to pass
    laws making it a penal offense for a citizen of the United States or
    Chinese subjects to take Chinese subjects either to the United States
    or to any other foreign country without their free and voluntary
    consent," constitutes the great force and value of this article. Its
    importance both in principle and in its practical service toward our
    protection against servile importation in the guise of immigration can
    not be overestimated. It commits the Chinese Government to active and
    efficient measures to suppress this iniquitous system, where those
    measures are most necessary and can be most effectual. It gives to
    this Government the footing of a treaty right to such measures and
    the means and opportunity of insisting upon their adoption and
    of complaint and resentment at their neglect. The fifth article,
    therefore, if it fall short of what the pressure of the later
    experience of our Pacific States may urge upon the attention of this
    Government as essential to the public welfare, seems to be in the
    right direction and to contain important advantages which once
    relinquished can not be easily recovered.
</p>
<p>
    The second topic which interested the two Governments under the actual
    condition of things which prompted the Burlingame treaty was adequate
    protection, under the solemn and definite guaranties of a treaty,
    of the Chinese already in this country and those who should seek
    our shores. This was the object, and forms the subject of the sixth
    article, by whose reciprocal engagement the citizens and subjects of
    the two Governments, respectively, visiting or residing in the
    country of the other are secured the same privileges, immunities,
    or exemptions there enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the most
    favored nations. The treaty of 1858, to which these articles are made
    supplemental, provides for a great amount of privilege and protection,
    both of person and property, to American citizens in China, but it is
    upon this sixth article that the main body of the treaty rights
    and securities of the Chinese already in this country depends. Its
    abrogation, were the rest of the treaty left in force, would leave
    them to such treatment as we should voluntarily accord them by our
    laws and customs. Any treaty obligation would be wanting to restrain
    our liberty of action toward them, or to measure or sustain the right
    of the Chinese Government to complaint or redress in their behalf.
</p>
<p>
    The lapse of ten years since the negotiation of the Burlingame treaty
    has exhibited to the notice of the Chinese Government, as well as to
    our own people, the working of this experiment of immigration in great
    numbers of Chinese laborers to this country, and their maintenance
    here of all the traits of race, religion, manners, and customs,
    habitations, mode of life, segregation here, and the keeping up of
    the ties of their original home, which stamp them as strangers and
    sojourners, and not as incorporated elements of our national life and
    growth. This experience may naturally suggest the reconsideration of
    the subject as dealt with by the Burlingame treaty, and may properly
    become the occasion of more and circumspect recognition, in renewed
    negotiations, of the difficulties surrounding this political and
    social problem. It may well be that, to the apprehension of the
    Chinese Government no less than our own, the simple provisions of the
    Burlingame treaty may need to be replaced by more careful methods,
    securing the Chinese and ourselves against a larger and more rapid
    infusion of this foreign race than our system of industry and
    society can take up and assimilate with ease and safety. This ancient
    Government, ruling a polite and sensitive people, distinguished by
    a high sense of national pride, may properly desire an adjustment of
    their relations with us which would in all things confirm and in no
    degree endanger the permanent peace and amity and the growing commerce
    and prosperity which it has been the object and the effect of our
    existing treaties to cherish and perpetuate.
</p>
<p>
    I regard the very grave discontents of the people of the Pacific
    States with the present working of the Chinese immigration, and their
    still graver apprehensions therefrom in the future, as deserving
    the most serious attention of the people of the whole country and a
    solicitous interest on the part of Congress and the Executive. If this
    were not my own judgment, the passage of this bill by both Houses of
    Congress would impress upon me the seriousness of the situation, when
    a majority of the representatives of the people of the whole country
    had thought fit to justify so serious a measure of relief.
</p>
<p>
    The authority of Congress to terminate a treaty with a foreign power
    by expressing the will of the nation no longer to adhere to it is
    as free from controversy under our Constitution as is the further
    proposition that the power of making new treaties or modifying
    existing treaties is not lodged by the Constitution in Congress, but
    in the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, as
    shown by the concurrence of two-thirds of that body. A denunciation of
    a treaty by any government is confessedly justifiable only upon some
    reason both of the highest justice and of the highest necessity. The
    action of Congress in the matter of the French treaties in 1798, if
    it be regarded as an abrogation by this nation of a subsisting treaty,
    strongly illustrates the character and degree of justification which
    was then thought suitable to such a proceeding. The preamble of the
    act recites that the&mdash;
</p>
<p class="q">
  Treaties concluded between the United States and France have been
  repeatedly violated on the part of the French Government, and the
  just claims of the United States for reparation of the injuries
  so committed have been refused, and their attempts to negotiate an
  amicable adjustment of all complaints between the two nations have
  been repelled with indignity.
</p>
<p>
    And that&mdash;
</p>
<p class="q">
  Under authority of the French Government there is yet pursued against
  the United States a system of predatory violence, infracting the said
  treaties and hostile to the rights of a free and independent nation.
</p>
<p>
    The enactment, as a logical consequence of these recited facts,
    declares&mdash;
</p>
<p class="q">
  That the United States are of right freed and exonerated from the
  stipulations of the treaties and of the consular convention heretofore
  concluded between the United States and France, and that the same
  shall not henceforth be regarded as legally obligatory on the
  Government or citizens of the United States.
</p>
<p>
    The history of the Government shows no other instance of an abrogation
    of a treaty by Congress.
</p>
<p>
    Instances have sometimes occurred where the ordinary legislation
    of Congress has, by its conflict with some treaty obligation of the
    Government toward a foreign power, taken effect as an <i>infraction</i>
    of the treaty, and been judicially declared to be operative to that
    result; but neither such legislation nor such judicial sanction of the
    same has been regarded as an <i>abrogation</i>, even for the moment, of
    the treaty. On the contrary, the treaty in such case still subsists
    between the governments, and the casual infraction is repaired by
    appropriate satisfaction in maintenance of the treaty.
</p>
<p>
    The bill before me does not enjoin upon the President the abrogation
    of the entire Burlingame treaty, much less of the principal treaty of
    which it is made the supplement. As the power of modifying an existing
    treaty, whether by adding or striking out provisions, is a part of
    the treaty-making power under the Constitution, its exercise is not
    competent for Congress, nor would the assent of China to this partial
    abrogation of the treaty make the action of Congress in thus procuring
    an amendment of a treaty a competent exercise of authority under the
    Constitution. The importance, however, of this special consideration
    seems superseded by the principle that a denunciation of a part of a
    treaty not made by the terms of the treaty itself separable from
    the rest is a denunciation of the whole treaty. As the other high
    contracting party has entered into no treaty obligations except such
    as include the part denounced, the denunciation by one party of the
    part necessarily liberates the other party from the whole treaty.
</p>
<p>
    I am convinced that, whatever urgency might in any quarter or by any
    interest be supposed to require an instant suppression of further
    immigration from China, no reasons can require the immediate
    withdrawal of our treaty protection of the Chinese already in this
    country, and no circumstances can tolerate an exposure of our citizens
    in China, merchants or missionaries, to the consequences of so sudden
    an abrogation of their treaty protection. Fortunately, however, the
    actual recession in the flow of the emigration from China to the
    Pacific Coast, shown by trustworthy statistics, relieves us from any
    apprehension that the treatment of the subject in the proper course of
    diplomatic negotiations will introduce any new features of discontent
    or disturbance among the communities directly affected. Were such
    delay fraught with more inconveniences than have ever been suggested
    by the interests most earnest in promoting this legislation, I can not
    but regard the summary disturbance of our existing treaties with
    China as greatly more inconvenient to much wider and more permanent
    interests of the country.
</p>
<p>
    I have no occasion to insist upon the more general considerations of
    interest and duty which sacredly guard the faith of the nation, in
    whatever form of obligation it may have been given. These sentiments
    animate the deliberations of Congress and pervade the minds of our
    whole people. Our history gives little occasion for any reproach in
    this regard; and in asking the renewed attention of Congress to this
    bill I am persuaded that their action will maintain the public duty
    and the public honor.

<p>
    Whereas the final adjournment of the Forty-fifth Congress without
    making the usual and necessary appropriations for the legislative,

    year ending June 30, 1880, and without making the usual and necessary

</p>
<p>
    Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United

    WASHINGTON, <i>March 19, 1879</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:</i>
</p>
<p>
    The failure of the last Congress to make the requisite appropriations
    for legislative and judicial purposes, for the expenses of the several
    Executive Departments of the Government, and for the support of
    the Army has made it necessary to call a special session of the
    Forty-sixth Congress.
</p>
<p>
    The estimates of the appropriations needed which were sent to Congress
    by the Secretary of the Treasury at the opening of the last session
    are renewed, and are herewith transmitted to both the Senate and the
    House of Representatives.
</p>
<p>
    Regretting the existence of the emergency which requires a special
    session of Congress at a time when it is the general judgment of the
    country that the public welfare will be best promoted by permanency in
    our legislation and by peace and rest, I commend these few necessary
    measures to your considerate attention.

<p>
    The bill making provision for the payment of the fees of United States
    marshals and their general deputies, which I have this day returned
    to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, with my
    objections,<a href="#note-27"><small>27</small></a> having upon its reconsideration by that body failed

    necessity of making some adequate provision for the due and efficient
    execution by the marshals and deputy marshals of the United States of
    the constant and important duties enjoined upon them by the existing
    laws. All appropriations to provide for the performance of these
    indispensable duties expire to-day. Under the laws prohibiting public
    officers from involving the Government in contract liabilities beyond
    actual appropriations, it is apparent that the means at the disposal
    of the executive department for executing the laws through the
    regular ministerial officers will after to-day be left inadequate. The
    suspension of these necessary functions in the orderly administration
    of the first duties of government for the shortest period is
    inconsistent with the public interests, and at any moment may prove
    inconsistent with the public safety.

    It is impossible for me to look without grave concern upon a state of
    things which will leave the public service thus unprovided for and
    the public interests thus unprotected, and I earnestly urge upon your

    maintenance of the service of the marshals and deputy marshals for the

<h2>
    VETO MESSAGES.
</h2>
<p class="r">
    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>April 29, 1879</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    I have maturely considered the important questions presented by the
    bill entitled "An act making appropriations for the support of
    the Army for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, and for other
    purposes," and I now return it to the House of Representatives, in
    which it originated, with my objections to its approval.
</p>
<p>
    The bill provides in the usual form for the appropriations required
    for the support of the Army during the next fiscal year. If it
    contained no other provisions, it would receive my prompt approval. It
    includes, however, further legislation, which, attached, as it is, to
    appropriations which are requisite for the efficient performance
    of some of the most necessary duties of the Government, involves
    questions of the gravest character. The sixth section of the bill is
    amendatory of the statute now in force in regard to the authority of
    persons in the civil, military, and naval service of the United States
    "at the place where any general or special election is held in any
    State." This statute was adopted February 25, 1865, after a protracted
    debate in the Senate, and almost without opposition in the House
    of Representatives, by the concurrent votes of both of the leading
    political parties of the country, and became a law by the approval of
    President Lincoln. It was reenacted in 1874 in the Revised Statutes of
    the United States, sections 2002 and 5528, which are as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 2002. No military or naval officer, or other person
  engaged in the civil, military, or naval service of the United
  States, shall order, bring, keep, or have under his authority
  or control any troops or armed men at the place where any
  general or special election is held in any State, unless it be
  necessary to repel the armed enemies of the United States or
  to keep the peace at the polls.
</p><p class="q">
  SEC. 5528. Every officer of the Army or Navy, or other person
  in the civil, military, or naval service of the United States,
  who orders, brings, keeps, or has under his authority or
  control any troops or armed men at any place where a general
  or special election is held in any State, unless such force
  be necessary to repel armed enemies of the United States or
  to keep the peace at the polls, shall be fined not more than
  $5,000 and surfer imprisonment at hard labor not less than
  three months nor more than five years.
</p>
<p>
    The amendment proposed to this statute in the bill before me omits
    from both of the foregoing sections the words "or to keep the peace
    at the polls," The effect of the adoption of this amendment may be
    considered&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    First. Upon the right of the United States Government to use military
    force to keep the peace at the elections for Members of Congress; and
</p>
<p>
    Second. Upon the right of the Government, by civil authority, to
    protect these elections from violence and fraud.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the sections of the statute above quoted, the following
    provisions of law relating to the use of the military power at the
    elections are now in force:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 2003. No officer of the Army or Navy of the United States
  shall prescribe or fix, or attempt to prescribe or fix, by
  proclamation, order, or otherwise, the qualifications of
  voters in any State, or in any manner interfere with the
  freedom of any election in any State, or with the exercise of
  the free right of suffrage in any State.
</p><p class="q">
  SEC. 5529. Every officer or other person in the military or
  naval service who, by force, threat, intimidation, order,
  advice, or otherwise, prevents, or attempts to prevent, any
  qualified voter of any State from freely exercising the right
  of suffrage at any general or special election in such State
  shall be fined not more than $5,000 and imprisoned at hard
  labor not more than five years.
</p><p class="q">
  SEC. 5530. Every officer of the Army or Navy who prescribes
  or fixes, or attempts to prescribe or fix, whether by
  proclamation, order, or otherwise, the qualifications of
  voters at any election in any State shall be punished as
  provided in the preceding section.
</p><p class="q">
  SEC. 5531. Every officer or other person in the military or
  naval service who, by force, threat, intimidation, order, or
  otherwise, compels, or attempts to compel, any officer holding
  an election in any State to receive a vote from a person not
  legally qualified to vote, or who imposes, or attempts to
  impose, any regulations for conducting any general or special
  election in a State different from those prescribed by law, or
  who interferes in any manner with any officer of an election
  in the discharge of his duty, shall be punished as provided in
  section 5529.
</p><p class="q">
  SEC. 5532. Every person convicted of any of the offenses
  specified in the five preceding sections shall, in addition to
  the punishments therein severally prescribed, be disqualified
  from holding any office of honor, profit, or trust under
  the United States; but nothing in those sections shall be
  construed to prevent any officer, soldier, sailor, or marine
  from exercising the right of suffrage in any election district
  to which he may belong, if otherwise qualified according to
  the laws of the State in which he offers to vote.
</p>
<p>
    The foregoing enactments would seem to be sufficient to prevent
    military interference with the elections. But the last Congress, to
    remove all apprehension of such interference, added to this body of
    law section 15 of an act entitled "An act making appropriations for
    the support of the Army for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, and
    for other purposes," approved June 18, 1878, which is as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 15. From and after the passage of this act it shall not
  be lawful to employ any part of the Army of the United States,
  as a <i>posse comitatus</i> or otherwise, for the purpose of
  executing the laws, except in such cases and under such
  circumstances as such employment of said force may be
  expressly authorized by the Constitution or by act of
  Congress; and no money appropriated by this act shall be used
  to pay any of the expenses incurred in the employment of any
  troops in violation of this section; and any person willfully
  violating the provisions of this section shall be deemed
  guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be
  punished by fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment not
  exceeding two years, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
</p>
<p>
    This act passed the Senate, after full consideration, without a single
    vote recorded against it on its final passage, and, by a majority
    of more than two-thirds, it was concurred in by the House of
    Representatives.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the section quoted was stated in the Senate by one of
    its supporters as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  Therefore I hope, without getting into any controversy about
  the past, but acting wisely for the future, that we shall
  take away the idea that the Army can be used by a general or
  special deputy marshal, or any marshal, merely for election
  purposes, as a posse, ordering them about the polls or
  ordering them anywhere else, when there is an election going
  on, to prevent disorders or to suppress disturbances that
  should be suppressed by the peace officers of the State; or,
  if they must bring others to their aid they should summon the
  unorganized citizens, and not summon the officers and men of
  the Army as <i>posse comitatus</i> to quell disorders, and thus
  get up a feeling which will be disastrous to peace among the
  people of the country.
</p>
<p>
    In the House of Representatives the object of the act of 1878 was
    stated by the gentleman who had it in charge in similar terms. He
    said:
</p>
<p class="q">
  But these are all minor points and insignificant questions
  compared with the great principle which was incorporated by
  the House in the bill in reference to the use of the Army
  in time of peace. The Senate had already conceded what they
  called and what we might accept as the principle, but they
  had stricken out the penalty, and had stricken out the word
  "<i>expressly</i>" so that the Army might be used in all cases
  where <i>implied</i> authority might be inferred. The House
  committee planted themselves firmly upon the doctrine that
  rather than yield this fundamental principle, for which for
  three years this House had struggled, they would allow
  the bill to fail, notwithstanding the reforms which we had
  secured, regarding these reforms as of but little consequence
  alongside the great principle that the Army of the United
  States, in time of peace, should be under the control of
  Congress and obedient to its laws. After a long and protracted
  negotiation, the Senate committee have conceded that principle
  in all its length and breadth, including the penalty, which
  the Senate had stricken out. We bring you back, therefore,
  a report, with the alteration of a single word, which the
  lawyers assure me is proper to be made, restoring to this bill
  the principle for which we have contended so long, and which
  is so vital to secure the rights and liberties of the people.
</p>
<hr>
<p class="q">
  Thus have we this day secured to the people of this country
  the same great protection against a standing army which cost
  a struggle of two hundred years for the Commons of England to
  secure for the British people.
</p>
<p>
    From this brief review of the subject it sufficiently appears that
    under existing laws there can be no military interference with the
    elections. No case of such interference has, in fact, occurred since
    the passage of the act last referred to. No soldier of the United
    States has appeared under orders at any place of election in any
    State. No complaint even of the presence of United States troops has
    been made in any quarter. It may therefore be confidently stated
    that there is no necessity for the enactment of section 6 of the bill
    before me to prevent military interference with the elections. The
    laws already in force are all that is required for that end.
</p>
<p>
    But that part of section 6 of this bill which is significant and
    vitally important is the clause which, if adopted, will deprive the
    civil authorities of the United States of all power to keep the peace
    at the Congressional elections. The Congressional elections in every
    district, in a very important sense, are justly a matter of political
    interest and concern throughout the whole country. Each State, every
    political party, is entitled to the share of power which is conferred
    by the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the right of every
    citizen possessing the qualifications prescribed by law to cast one
    unintimidated ballot and to have his ballot honestly counted. So long
    as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of this right are
    common and equal, practically as well as formally, submission to the
    results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and
    all the departments of Government will feel the true vigor of the
    popular will thus expressed.
</p>
<p>
    Two provisions of the Constitution authorize legislation by Congress
    for the regulation of the Congressional elections.
</p>
<p>
    Section 4 of Article I of the Constitution declares&mdash;
</p>
<p class="q">
  The times, places, and manner of holding elections for
  Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State
  by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time,
  by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the
  places of choosing Senators.
</p>
<p>
    The fifteenth amendment of the Constitution is as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote
  shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by
  any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of
  servitude.
</p><p class="q">
  SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article
  by appropriate legislation.
</p>
<p>
    The Supreme Court has held that this amendment invests the citizens of
    the United States with a new constitutional right which is within
    the protecting power of Congress. That right the court declares to
    be exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective
    franchise on account of race, color, or previous condition of
    servitude. The power of Congress to protect this right by appropriate
    legislation is expressly affirmed by the court.
</p>
<p>
    National legislation to provide safeguards for free and honest
    elections is necessary, as experience has shown, not only to secure
    the right to vote to the enfranchised race at the South, but also to
    prevent fraudulent voting in the large cities of the North. Congress
    has therefore exercised the power conferred by the Constitution, and
    has enacted certain laws to prevent discriminations on account of
    race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and to punish fraud,
    violence, and intimidation at Federal elections. Attention is called
    to the following sections of the Revised Statutes of the United
    States, viz:
</p>
<p>
    Section 2004, which guarantees to all citizens the right to vote,
    without distinction on account of race, color, or previous condition
    of servitude.
</p>
<p>
    Sections 2005 and 2006, which guarantee to all citizens equal
    opportunity, without discrimination, to perform all the acts required
    by law as a prerequisite or qualification for voting.
</p>
<p>
    Section 2022, which authorizes the United States marshal and
    his deputies to keep the peace and preserve order at the Federal
    elections.
</p>
<p>
    Section 2024, which expressly authorizes the United States marshal
    and his deputies to summon a <i>posse comitatus</i> whenever they or any of
    them are forcibly resisted in the execution of their duties under the
    law or are prevented from executing such duties by violence.
</p>
<p>
    Section 5522, which provides for the punishment of the crime of
    interfering with the supervisors of elections and deputy marshals in
    the discharge of their duties at the elections of Representatives in
    Congress.
</p>
<p>
    These are some of the laws on this subject which it is the duty of
    the executive department of the Government to enforce. The intent and
    effect of the sixth section of this bill is to prohibit all the civil
    officers of the United States, under penalty of fine and imprisonment,
    from employing any adequate civil force for this purpose at the place
    where their enforcement is most necessary, namely, at the places
    where the Congressional elections are held. Among the most valuable
    enactments to which I have referred are those which protect the
    supervisors of Federal elections in the discharge of their duties at
    the polls. If the proposed legislation should become the law, there
    will be no power vested in any officer of the Government to protect
    from violence the officers of the United States engaged in the
    discharge of their duties. Their rights and duties under the law will
    remain, but the National Government will be powerless to enforce its
    own statutes. The States may employ both military and civil power to
    keep the peace and to enforce the laws at State elections. It is
    now proposed to deny to the United States even the necessary civil
    authority to protect the national elections. No sufficient reason has
    been given for this discrimination in favor of the State and against
    the national authority. If well-founded objections exist against the
    present national election laws, all good citizens should unite in
    their amendment. The laws providing the safeguards of the elections
    should be impartial, just, and efficient. They should, if possible,
    be so nonpartisan and fair in their operation that the minority&mdash;the
    party out of power&mdash;will have no just grounds to complain. The present
    laws have in practice unquestionably conduced to the prevention of
    fraud and violence at the elections. In several of the States members
    of different political parties have applied for the safeguards which
    they furnish. It is the right and duty of the National Government to
    enact and enforce laws which will secure free and fair Congressional
    elections. The laws now in force should not be repealed except in
    connection with the enactment of measures which will better accomplish
    that important end. Believing that section 6 of the bill before me
    will weaken, if it does not altogether take away, the power of the
    National Government to protect the Federal elections by the civil
    authorities, I am forced to the conclusion that it ought not to
    receive my approval.
</p>
<p>
    This section is, however, not presented to me as a separate and
    independent measure, but is, as has been stated, attached to the bill
    making the usual annual appropriations for the support of the Army. It
    makes a vital change in the election laws of the country, which is in
    no way connected with the use of the Army. It prohibits, under heavy
    penalties, any person engaged in the civil service of the United
    States from having any force at the place of any election, prepared to
    preserve order, to make arrests, to keep the peace, or in any manner
    to enforce the laws. This is altogether foreign to the purpose of
    an Army appropriation bill. The practice of tacking to appropriation
    bills measures not pertinent to such bills did not prevail until more
    than forty years after the adoption of the Constitution. It has become
    a common practice. All parties when in power have adopted it. Many
    abuses and great waste of public money have in this way crept into
    appropriation bills. The public opinion of the country is against it.
    The States which have recently adopted constitutions have generally
    provided a remedy for the evil by enacting that no law shall contain
    more than one subject, which shall be plainly expressed in its
    title. The constitutions of more than half of the States contain
    substantially this provision. The public welfare will be promoted in
    many ways by a return to the early practice of the Government and to
    the true principle of legislation, which requires that every measure
    shall stand or fall according to its own merits. If it were understood
    that to attach to an appropriation bill a measure irrelevant to the
    general object of the bill would imperil and probably prevent its
    final passage and approval, a valuable reform in the parliamentary
    practice of Congress would be accomplished. The best justification
    that has been offered for attaching irrelevant riders to appropriation
    bills is that it is done for convenience sake, to facilitate the
    passage of measures which are deemed expedient by all the branches
    of Government which participate in legislation. It can not be claimed
    that there is any such reason for attaching this amendment of the
    election laws to the Army appropriation bill. The history of the
    measure contradicts this assumption. A majority of the House of
    Representatives in the last Congress was in favor of section 6 of this
    bill. It was known that a majority of the Senate was opposed to
    it, and that as a separate measure it could not be adopted. It was
    attached to the Army appropriation bill to compel the Senate to
    assent to it. It was plainly announced to the Senate that the Army
    appropriation bill would not be allowed to pass unless the proposed
    amendments of the election laws were adopted with it. The Senate
    refused to assent to the bill on account of this irrelevant section.
    Congress thereupon adjourned without passing an appropriation bill for
    the Army, and the present extra session of the Forty-sixth Congress
    became necessary to furnish the means to carry on the Government.
</p>
<p>
    The ground upon which the action of the House of Representatives is
    defended has been distinctly stated by many of its advocates. A week
    before the close of the last session of Congress the doctrine in
    question was stated by one of its ablest defenders as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  It is our duty to repeal these laws. It is not worth while
  to attempt the repeal except upon an appropriation bill.
  The Republican Senate would not agree to nor the Republican
  President sign a bill for such repeal. Whatever objection to
  legislation upon appropriation bills may be made in ordinary
  cases does not apply where free elections and the liberty of
  the citizens are concerned. * * * We have the power to vote
  money; let us annex conditions to it, and insist upon the
  redress of grievances.
</p>
<p>
    By another distinguished member of the House it was said:
</p>
<p class="q">
  The right of the Representatives of the people to withhold
  supplies is as old as English liberty. History records
  numerous instances where the Commons, feeling that the people
  were oppressed by laws that the Lords would not consent
  to repeal by the ordinary methods of legislation, obtained
  redress at last by refusing appropriations unless accompanied
  by relief measures.
</p>
<p>
    That a question of the gravest magnitude, and new in this country, was
    raised by this course of proceeding, was fully recognized also by its
    defenders in the Senate. It was said by a distinguished Senator:
</p>
<p class="q">
  Perhaps no greater question, in the form we are brought to
  consider it, was ever considered by the American Congress
  in time of peace; for it involves not merely the merits or
  demerits of the laws which the House bill proposes to repeal,
  but involves the rights, the privileges, the powers, the
  duties of the two branches of Congress and of the President
  of the United States. It is a vast question; it is a question
  whose importance can scarcely be estimated; it is a question
  that never yet has been brought so sharply before the American
  Congress and the American people as it may be now. It is
  a question which sooner or later must be decided, and the
  decision must determine what are the powers of the House of
  Representatives under the Constitution, and what is the duty
  of that House in the view of the framers of that Constitution,
  according to its letter and its spirit.
</p><p class="q">
  Mr. President, I should approach this question, if I were in
  the best possible condition to speak and to argue it, with
  very grave diffidence, and certainly with the utmost anxiety;
  for no one can think of it as long and as carefully as I have
  thought of it without seeing that we are at the beginning,
  perhaps, of a struggle that may last as long in this country
  as a similar struggle lasted in what we are accustomed to call
  the mother land. There the struggle lasted for two centuries
  before it was ultimately decided. It is not likely to last so
  long here, but it may last until every man in this chamber is
  in his grave. It is the question whether or no the House of
  Representatives has a right to say, "We will grant supplies
  only upon condition that grievances are redressed. We are
  the representatives of the taxpayers of the Republic. We, the
  House of Representatives, alone have the right to originate
  money bills. We, the House of Representatives, have alone the
  right to originate bills which grant the money of the people.
  The Senate represents States; we represent the taxpayers
  of the Republic. We, therefore, by the very terms of the
  Constitution, are charged with the duty of originating the
  bills which grant the money of the people. We claim the right,
  which the House of Commons in England established after two
  centuries of contest, to say that we will not grant the money
  of the people unless there is a redress of grievances."
</p>
<p>
    Upon the assembling of this Congress, in pursuance of a call for
    an extra session, which was made necessary by the failure of the
    Forty-fifth Congress to make the needful appropriations for the
    support of the Government, the question was presented whether the
    attempt made in the last Congress to ingraft by construction a new
    principle upon the Constitution should be persisted in or not. This
    Congress has ample opportunity and time to pass the appropriation
    bills, and also to enact any political measures which may be
    determined upon in separate bills by the usual and orderly methods
    of proceeding. But the majority of both Houses have deemed it wise to
    adhere to the principles asserted and maintained in the last Congress
    by the majority of the House of Representatives. That principle is
    that the House of Representatives has the sole right to originate
    bills for raising revenue, and therefore has the right to withhold
    appropriations upon which the existence of the Government may depend
    unless the Senate and the President shall give their assent to any
    legislation which the House may see fit to attach to appropriation
    bills. To establish this principle is to make a radical, dangerous,
    and unconstitutional change in the character of our institutions. The
    various departments of the Government and the Army and the Navy
    are established by the Constitution or by laws passed in pursuance
    thereof. Their duties are clearly defined and their support is
    carefully provided for by law. The money required for this purpose has
    been collected from the people and is now in the Treasury, ready to
    be paid out as soon as the appropriation bills are passed. Whether
    appropriations are made or not, the collection of the taxes will go
    on. The public money will accumulate in the Treasury. It was not the
    intention of the framers of the Constitution that any single branch of
    the Government should have the power to dictate conditions upon
    which this treasure should be applied to the purpose for which it was
    collected. Any such intention, if it had been entertained, would have
    been plainly expressed in the Constitution.
</p>
<p>
    That a majority of the Senate now concurs in the claim of the House
    adds to the gravity of the situation, but does not alter the
    question at issue. The new doctrine, if maintained, will result in
    a consolidation of unchecked and despotic power in the House of
    Representatives. A bare majority of the House will become the
    Government. The Executive will no longer be what the framers of
    the Constitution intended&mdash;an equal and independent branch of the
    Government. It is clearly the constitutional duty of the President to
    exercise his discretion and judgment upon all bills presented to him
    without constraint or duress from any other branch of the Government.
    To say that a majority of either or both of the Houses of Congress may
    insist upon the approval of a bill under the penalty of stopping all
    of the operations of the Government for want of the necessary supplies
    is to deny to the Executive that share of the legislative power which
    is plainly conferred by the second section of the seventh article
    of the Constitution. It strikes from the Constitution the qualified
    negative of the President. It is said that this should be done
    because it is the peculiar function of the House of Representatives to
    represent the will of the people. But no single branch or department
    of the Government has exclusive authority to speak for the American
    people. The most authentic and solemn expression of their will
    is contained in the Constitution of the United States. By that
    Constitution they have ordained and established a Government whose
    powers are distributed among coordinate branches, which, as far as
    possible consistently with a harmonious cooperation, are absolutely
    independent of each other. The people of this country are unwilling to
    see the supremacy of the Constitution replaced by the omnipotence of
    any one department of the Government.
</p>
<p>
    The enactment of this bill into a law will establish a precedent which
    will tend to destroy the equal independence of the several branches
    of the Government. Its principle places not merely the Senate and the
    Executive, but the judiciary also, under the coercive dictation of
    the House. The House alone will be the judge of what constitutes a
    grievance, and also of the means and measure of redress. An act of
    Congress to protect elections is now the grievance complained of; but
    the House may on the same principle determine that any other act of
    Congress, a treaty made by the President with the advice and consent
    of the Senate, a nomination or appointment to office, or that a
    decision or opinion of the Supreme Court is a grievance, and that the
    measure of redress is to withhold the appropriations required for the
    support of the offending branch of the Government.
</p>
<p>
    Believing that this bill is a dangerous violation of the spirit and
    meaning of the Constitution, I am compelled to return it to the House
    in which it originated without my approval. The qualified negative
    with which the Constitution invests the President is a trust that
    involves a duty which he can not decline to perform. With a firm and
    conscientious purpose to do what I can to preserve unimpaired the
    constitutional powers and equal independence, not merely of the
    Executive, but of every branch of the Government, which will be
    imperiled by the adoption of the principle of this bill, I desire
    earnestly to urge upon the House of Representatives a return to the
    wise and wholesome usage of the earlier days of the Republic, which
    excluded from appropriation bills all irrelevant legislation. By
    this course you will inaugurate an important reform in the method of
    Congressional legislation; your action will be in harmony with the
    fundamental principles of the Constitution and the patriotic sentiment
    of nationality which is their firm support, and you will restore to
    the country that feeling of confidence and security and the
    repose which are so essential to the prosperity of all of our
    fellow-citizens.

    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    <i>To the House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    After a careful consideration of the bill entitled "An act to prohibit
    military interference at elections," I return it to the House of
    Representatives, in which it originated, with the following objections
    to its approval:
</p>
<p>
    In the communication sent to the House of Representatives on the 29th
    of last month, returning to the House without my approval the bill
    entitled "An act making appropriations for the support of the Army
    for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, and for other purposes,"
    I endeavored to show, by quotations from the statutes of the United
    States now in force and by a brief statement of facts in regard to
    recent elections in the several States, that no additional legislation
    was necessary to prevent interference with the elections by the
    military or naval forces of the United States. The fact was presented
    in that communication that at the time of the passage of the act of
    June 18, 1878, in relation to the employment of the Army as a <i>posse
    comitatus</i> or otherwise, it was maintained by its friends that it
    would establish a vital and fundamental principle which would secure,
    to the people protection against a standing army. The fact was also
    referred to that since the passage of this act Congressional, State,
    and municipal elections have been held throughout the Union, and
    that in no instance has complaint been made of the presence of United
    States soldiers at the polls.
</p>
<p>
    Holding, as I do, the opinion that any military interference whatever
    at the polls is contrary to the spirit of our institutions and would
    tend to destroy the freedom of elections, and sincerely desiring to
    concur with Congress in all of its measures, it is with very great
    regret that I am forced to the conclusion that the bill before me is
    not only unnecessary to prevent such interference, but is a dangerous
    departure from long-settled and important constitutional principles.
</p>
<p>
    The true rule as to the employment of military force at the elections
    is not doubtful. No intimidation or coercion should be allowed to
    control or influence citizens in the exercise of their right to vote,
    whether it appears in the shape of combinations of evil-disposed
    persons, or of armed bodies of the militia of a State, or of the
    military force of the United States.
</p>
<p>
    The elections should be free from all forcible interference, and, as
    far as practicable, from all apprehensions of such interference.
    No soldiers, either of the Union or of the State militia, should be
    present at the polls to take the place or to perform the duties of the
    ordinary civil police force. There has been and will be no violation
    of this rule under orders from me during this Administration; but
    there should be no denial of the right of the National Government to
    employ its military force on any day and at any place in case such
    employment is necessary to enforce the Constitution and laws of the
    United States.
</p>
<p>
    The bill before me is as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  <i>Be it enacted, etc.</i>, That it shall not be lawful to bring to
  or employ at any place where a general or special election
  is being held in a State any part of the Army or Navy of the
  United States, unless such force be necessary to repel the
  armed enemies of the United States or to enforce section 4,
  Article IV, of the Constitution of the United States and
  the laws made in pursuance thereof, on application of the
  legislature or executive of the State where such force is to
  be used; and so much of all laws as is inconsistent herewith
  is hereby repealed.
</p>
<p>
    It will be observed that the bill exempts from the general prohibition
    against the employment of military force at the polls two specified
    cases. These exceptions recognize and concede the soundness of the
    principle that military force may properly and constitutionally be
    used at the place of elections when such use is necessary to enforce
    the Constitution and the laws; but the excepted cases leave the
    prohibition so extensive and far-reaching that its adoption will
    seriously impair the efficiency of the executive department of the
    Government.
</p>
<p>
    The first act expressly authorizing the use of military power to
    execute the laws was passed almost as early as the organization of
    the Government under the Constitution, and was approved by President
    Washington May 2, 1792. It is as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 2. <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That whenever the laws
  of the United States shall be opposed or the execution thereof
  obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be
  suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or
  by the powers vested in the marshals by this act, the same
  being notified to the President of the United States by an
  associate justice or the district judge, it shall be lawful
  for the President of the United States to call forth the
  militia of such State to suppress such combinations and to
  cause the laws to be duly executed. And if the militia of a
  State where such combination may happen shall refuse or be
  insufficient to suppress the same, it shall be lawful for the
  President, if the Legislature of the United States be not in
  session, to call forth and employ such numbers of the militia
  of any other State or States most convenient thereto as may be
  necessary; and the use of militia so to be called forth may be
  continued, if necessary, until the expiration of thirty days
  after the commencement of the ensuing session.
</p>
<p>
    In 1795 this provision was substantially reenacted in a law which
    repealed the act of 1792. In 1807 the following act became the law by
    the approval of President Jefferson:
</p>
<p class="q">
  That in all cases of insurrection or obstruction to the laws,
  either of the United States or of any individual State or
  Territory, where it is lawful for the President of the
  United States to call forth the militia for the purpose of
  suppressing such insurrection or of causing the laws to be
  duly executed, it shall be lawful for him to employ for the
  same purposes such part of the land or naval force of the
  United States as shall be judged necessary, having first
  observed all the prerequisites of the law in that respect.
</p>
<p>
    By this act it will be seen that the scope of the law of 1795 was
    extended so as to authorize the National Government to use not only
    the militia, but the Army and Navy of the United States, in "causing
    the laws to be duly executed."
</p>
<p>
    The important provision of the acts of 1792, 1795, and 1807, modified
    in its terms from time to time to adapt it to the existing emergency,
    remained in force until, by an act approved by President Lincoln July
    29, 1861, it was reenacted substantially in the same language in which
    it is now found in the Revised Statutes, viz:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 5298. Whenever, by reason of unlawful obstructions,
  combinations, or assemblages of persons, or rebellion against
  the authority of the Government of the United States, it shall
  become impracticable, in the judgment of the President, to
  enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings the
  laws of the United States within any State or Territory, it
  shall be lawful for the President to call forth the militia of
  any or all the States and to employ such parts of the land and
  naval forces of the United States as he may deem necessary
  to enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United
  States or to suppress such rebellion, in whatever State
  or Territory thereof the laws of the United States may be
  forcibly opposed or the execution thereof forcibly obstructed.
</p>
<p>
    This ancient and fundamental law has been in force from the foundation
    of the Government. It is now proposed to abrogate it on certain days
    and at certain places. In my judgment no fact has been produced which
    tends to show that it ought to be repealed or suspended for a single
    hour at any place in any of the States or Territories of the Union.
    All the teachings of experience in the course of our history are in
    favor of sustaining its efficiency unimpaired. On every occasion when
    the supremacy of the Constitution has been resisted and the perpetuity
    of our institutions imperiled the principle of this statute, enacted
    by the fathers, has enabled the Government of the Union to maintain
    its authority and to preserve the integrity of the nation.
</p>
<p>
    At the most critical periods of our history my predecessors in the
    executive office have relied on this great principle. It was on this
    principle that President Washington suppressed the whisky rebellion in
    Pennsylvania in 1794.
</p>
<p>
    In 1806, on the same principle, President Jefferson broke up the Burr
    conspiracy by issuing "orders for the employment of such force, either
    of the regulars or of the militia, and by such proceedings of the
    civil authorities, * * * as might enable them to suppress effectually
    the further progress of the enterprise." And it was under the same
    authority that President Jackson crushed nullification in South
    Carolina and that President Lincoln issued his call for troops to save
    the Union in 1861. On numerous other occasions of less significance,
    under probably every Administration, and certainly under the present,
    this power has been usefully exerted to enforce the laws, without
    objection by any party in the country, and almost without attracting
    public attention.
</p>
<p>
    The great elementary constitutional principle which was the foundation
    of the original statute of 1792, and which has been its essence in
    the various forms it has assumed since its first adoption, is that the
    Government of the United States possesses under the Constitution,
    in full measure, the power of self-protection by its own agencies,
    altogether independent of State authority, and, if need be, against
    the hostility of State governments. It should remain embodied in
    our statutes unimpaired, as it has been from the very origin of the
    Government. It should be regarded as hardly less valuable or less
    sacred than a provision of the Constitution itself.
</p>
<p>
    There are many other important statutes containing provisions that are
    liable to be suspended or annulled at the times and places of
    holding elections if the bill before me should become a law. I do not
    undertake to furnish a list of them. Many of them&mdash;perhaps the most of
    them&mdash;have been set forth in the debates on this measure. They relate
    to extradition, to crimes against the election laws, to quarantine
    regulations, to neutrality, to Indian reservations, to the civil
    rights of citizens, and to other subjects. In regard to them all it
    may be safely said that the meaning and effect of this bill is to take
    from the General Government an important part of its power to enforce
    the laws.
</p>
<p>
    Another grave objection to the bill is its discrimination in favor
    of the State and against the national authority. The presence or
    employment of the Army or Navy of the United States is lawful under
    the terms of this bill at the place where an election is being held in
    a State to uphold the authority of a State government then and there
    in need of such military intervention, but unlawful to uphold the
    authority of the Government of the United States then and there in
    need of such military intervention. Under this bill the presence or
    employment of the Army or Navy of the United States would be lawful
    and might be necessary to maintain the conduct of a State election
    against the domestic violence that would overthrow it, but would be
    unlawful to maintain the conduct of a national election against the
    same local violence that would overthrow it. This discrimination has
    never been attempted in any previous legislation by Congress, and is
    no more compatible with sound principles of the Constitution or the
    necessary maxims and methods of our system of government on occasions
    of elections than at other times. In the early legislation of 1792
    and of 1795, by which the militia of the States was the only military
    power resorted to for the execution of the constitutional powers
    in support of State or national authority, both functions of the
    Government were put upon the same footing. By the act of 1807 the
    employment of the Army and Navy was authorized for the performance of
    both constitutional duties in the same terms.
</p>
<p>
    In all later statutes on the same subject-matter the same measure of
    authority to the Government has been accorded for the performance
    of both these duties. No precedent has been found in any previous
    legislation, and no sufficient reason has been given for the
    discrimination in favor of the State and against the national
    authority which this bill contains.
</p>
<p>
    Under the sweeping terms of the bill the National Government is
    effectually shut out from the exercise of the right and from the
    discharge of the imperative duty to use its whole executive power
    whenever and wherever required for the enforcement of its laws at the
    places and times when and where its elections are held. The employment
    of its organized armed forces for any such purpose would be an offense
    against the law unless called for by, and therefore upon permission
    of, the authorities of the State in which the occasion arises. What is
    this but the substitution of the discretion of the State governments
    for the discretion of the Government of the United States as to the
    performance of its own duties? In my judgment this is an abandonment
    of its obligations by the National Government&mdash;a subordination of
    national authority and an intrusion of State supervision over national
    duties which amounts, in spirit and tendency, to State supremacy.
</p>
<p>
    Though I believe that the existing statutes are abundantly adequate
    to completely prevent military interference with the elections in the
    sense in which the phrase is used in the title of this bill and is
    employed by the people of this country, I shall find no difficulty in
    concurring in any additional legislation limited to that object which
    does not interfere with the indispensable exercise of the powers of
    the Government under the Constitution and laws.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="r">
    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>May 29, 1879</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    After mature consideration of the bill entitled "An act making
    appropriations for the legislative, executive, and judicial expenses
    of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, and for
    other purposes," I herewith return it to the House of Representatives,
    in which it originated, with the following objections to its approval:
</p>
<p>
    The main purpose of the bill is to appropriate the money required to
    support during the next fiscal year the several civil departments
    of the Government. The amount appropriated exceeds in the aggregate
    $18,000,000.
</p>
<p>
    This money is needed to keep in operation the essential functions of
    all the great departments of the Government&mdash;legislative, executive,
    and judicial. If the bill contained no other provisions, no objection
    to its approval would be made. It embraces, however, a number of
    clauses, relating to subjects of great general interest, which are
    wholly unconnected with the appropriations which it provides for.
    The objections to the practice of tacking general legislation to
    appropriation bills, especially when the object is to deprive a
    coordinate branch of the Government of its right to the free exercise
    of its own discretion and judgment touching such general legislation,
    were set forth in the special message in relation to House bill No. 1,
    which was returned to the House of Representatives on the 29th of last
    month. I regret that the objections which were then expressed to this
    method of legislation have not seemed to Congress of sufficient weight
    to dissuade from this renewed incorporation of general enactments in
    an appropriation bill, and that my constitutional duty in respect of
    the general legislation thus placed before me can not be
    discharged without seeming to delay, however briefly, the necessary
    appropriations by Congress for the support of the Government. Without
    repeating these objections, I respectfully refer to that message for
    a statement of my views on the principle maintained in debate by the
    advocates of this bill, viz, that "to withhold appropriations is a
    constitutional means for the redress" of what the majority of the
    House of Representatives may regard as "a grievance."
</p>
<p>
    The bill contains the following clauses, viz:
</p>
<p class="q">
  <i>And provided further</i>, That the following sections of the
  Revised Statutes of the United States, namely, sections 2016,
  2018, and 2020, and all of the succeeding sections of said
  statutes down to and including section 2027, and also section
  5522, be, and the same are hereby, repealed; * * * and that
  all the other sections of the Revised Statutes, and all
  laws and parts of laws authorizing the appointment of
  chief supervisors of elections, special deputy marshals of
  elections, or general deputy marshals having any duties to
  perform in respect to any election, and prescribing their
  duties and powers and allowing them compensation, be, and the
  same are hereby, repealed.
</p>
<p>
    It also contains clauses amending sections 2017, 2019, 2028, and 2031
    of the Revised Statutes.
</p>
<p>
    The sections of the Revised Statutes which the bill, if approved,
    would repeal or amend are part of an act approved May 30, 1870, and
    amended February 28, 1871, entitled "An act to enforce the rights of
    citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of
    this Union, and for other purposes." All of the provisions of the
    above-named acts which it is proposed in this bill to repeal or modify
    relate to the Congressional elections. The remaining portion of the
    law, which will continue in force after the enactment of this measure,
    is that which provides for the appointment, by a judge of the circuit
    court of the United States, of two supervisors of election in each
    election district at any Congressional election, on due application
    of citizens who desire, in the language of the law, "to have such
    election <i>guarded</i> and <i>scrutinized</i>." The duties of the supervisors
    will be to attend at the polls at all Congressional elections, and
    to remain after the polls are open until every vote cast has been
    counted; but they will "have no authority to make arrests or to
    perform other duties than to be in the immediate presence of the
    officers holding the election and to witness all their proceedings,
    including the counting of the votes and the making of a return
    thereof." The part of the election law which will be repealed by the
    approval of this bill includes those sections which give authority
    to the supervisors of elections "to personally scrutinize, count, and
    canvass each ballot," and all the sections which confer authority upon
    the United States marshals and deputy marshals in connection with the
    Congressional elections. The enactment of this bill will also repeal
    section 5522 of the criminal statutes of the United States, which was
    enacted for the protection of United States officers engaged in the
    discharge of their duties at the Congressional elections. This section
    protects supervisors and marshals in the performance of their duties
    by making the obstruction or the assaulting of these officers, or
    any interference with them, by bribery or solicitation or otherwise,
    crimes against the United States.
</p>
<p>
    The true meaning and effect of the proposed legislation are plain. The
    supervisors, with the authority to observe and witness the proceedings
    at the Congressional elections, will be left, but there will be no
    power to protect them, or to prevent interference with their duties,
    or to punish any violation of the law from which their powers are
    derived. If this bill is approved, only the shadow of the authority of
    the United States at the national elections will remain; the substance
    will be gone. The supervision of the elections will be reduced to a
    mere inspection, without authority on the part of the supervisors to
    do any act whatever to make the election a fair one. All that will be
    left to the supervisors is the permission to have such oversight of
    the elections as political parties are in the habit of exercising
    without any authority of law, in order to prevent their opponents from
    obtaining unfair advantages. The object of the bill is to destroy
    any control whatever by the United States over the Congressional
    elections.
</p>
<p>
    The passage of this bill has been urged upon the ground that the
    election of members of Congress is a matter which concerns the States
    alone; that these elections should be controlled exclusively by
    the States; that there are and can be no such elections as national
    elections, and that the existing law of the United States regulating
    the Congressional elections is without warrant in the Constitution.
</p>
<p>
    It is evident, however, that the framers of the Constitution regarded
    the election of members of Congress in every State and in every
    district as in a very important sense justly a matter of political
    interest and concern to the whole country. The original provision of
    the Constitution on this subject is as follows (sec. 4, Art. I):
</p>
<p class="q">
  The times, places, and manner of holding elections for
  Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State
  by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time,
  by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the
  places of choosing Senators.
</p>
<p>
    A further provision has been since added, which is embraced in the
    fifteenth amendment. It is as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote
  shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by
  any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of
  servitude.
</p><p class="q">
  SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article
  by appropriate legislation.
</p>
<p>
    Under the general provision of the Constitution (sec. 4, Art. I)
    Congress in 1866 passed a comprehensive law which prescribed full and
    detailed regulations for the election of Senators by the legislatures
    of the several States. This law has been in force almost thirteen
    years. In pursuance of it all the members of the present Senate of the
    United States hold their seats. Its constitutionality is not called
    in question. It is confidently believed that no sound argument can
    be made in support of the constitutionality of national regulation of
    Senatorial elections which will not show that the elections of members
    of the House of Representatives may also be constitutionally regulated
    by the national authority.
</p>
<p>
    The bill before me itself recognizes the principle that the
    Congressional elections are not State elections, but national
    elections. It leaves in full force the existing statute under which
    supervisors are still to be appointed by national authority to
    "observe and witness" the Congressional elections whenever due
    application is made by citizens who desire said elections to be
    "guarded and scrutinized." If the power to supervise in any respect
    whatever the Congressional elections exists under section 4, Article
    I, of the Constitution, it is a power which, like every other power
    belonging to the Government of the United States, is paramount and
    supreme, and includes the right to employ the necessary means to carry
    it into effect.
</p>
<p>
    The statutes of the United States which regulate the election of
    members of the House of Representatives, an essential part of which
    it is proposed to repeal by this bill, have been in force about eight
    years. Four Congressional elections have been held under them, two of
    which were at the Presidential elections of 1872 and 1876. Numerous
    prosecutions, trials, and convictions have been had in the courts of
    the United States in all parts of the Union for violations of these
    laws. In no reported case has their constitutionality been called in
    question by any judge of the courts of the United States. The validity
    of these laws is sustained by the uniform course of judicial action
    and opinion.
</p>
<p>
    If it is urged that the United States election laws are not necessary,
    an ample reply is furnished by the history of their origin and of
    their results. They were especially prompted by the investigation and
    exposure of the frauds committed in the city and State of New York
    at the elections of 1868. Committees representing both of the leading
    political parties of the country have submitted reports to the House
    of Representatives on the extent of those frauds. A committee of the
    Fortieth Congress, after a full investigation, reached the conclusion
    that the number of fraudulent votes cast in the city of New York alone
    in 1868 was not less than 25,000. A committee of the Forty-fourth
    Congress in their report, submitted in 1877, adopted the opinion that
    for every 100 actual voters of the city of New York in 1868 108 votes
    were cast, when in fact the number of lawful votes cast could not
    have exceeded 88 per cent of the actual voters of the city. By this
    statement the number of fraudulent votes at that election in the city
    of New York alone was between thirty and forty thousand. These frauds
    completely reversed the result of the election in the State of New
    York, both as to the choice of governor and State officers and as to
    the choice of electors of President and Vice-President of the United
    States. They attracted the attention of the whole country. It was
    plain that if they could be continued and repeated with impunity free
    government was impossible. A distinguished Senator, in opposing the
    passage of the election laws, declared that he had "for a long time
    believed that our form of government was a comparative failure in the
    larger cities." To meet these evils and to prevent these crimes the
    United States laws regulating Congressional elections were enacted.
</p>
<p>
    The framers of these laws have not been disappointed in their results.
    In the large cities, under their provisions, the elections have been
    comparatively peaceable, orderly, and honest. Even the opponents of
    these laws have borne testimony to their value and efficiency and to
    the necessity for their enactment. The committee of the Forty-fourth
    Congress, composed of members a majority of whom were opposed to these
    laws, in their report on the New York election of 1876, said:
</p>
<p class="q">
  The committee would commend to other portions of the country
  and to other cities this remarkable system, developed through
  the agency of both local and Federal authorities acting in
  harmony for an honest purpose. In no portion of the world and
  in no era of time where there has been an expression of the
  popular will through the forms of law has there been a more
  complete and thorough illustration of republican institutions.
  Whatever may have been the previous habit or conduct of
  elections in those cities, or howsoever they may conduct
  themselves in the future, this election of 1876 will stand as
  a monument of what good faith, honest endeavor, legal forms,
  and just authority may do for the protection of the electoral
  franchise.
</p>
<p>
    This bill recognizes the authority and duty of the United States
    to appoint supervisors to guard and scrutinize the Congressional
    elections, but it denies to the Government of the United States all
    power to make its supervision effectual. The great body of the people
    of all parties want free and fair elections. They do not think that
    a free election means freedom from the wholesome restraints of law or
    that the place of election should be a sanctuary for lawlessness
    and crime. On the day of an election peace and good order are more
    necessary than on any other day of the year. On that day the humblest
    and feeblest citizens, the aged and the infirm, should be, and should
    have reason to feel that they are, safe in the exercise of their
    most responsible duty and their most sacred right as members of
    society&mdash;their duty and their right to vote. The constitutional
    authority to regulate the Congressional elections which belongs to the
    Government of the United States, and which it is necessary to exert
    to secure the right to vote to every citizen possessing the requisite
    qualifications, ought to be enforced by appropriate legislation.
    So far from public opinion in any part of the country favoring any
    relaxation of the authority of the Government in the protection of
    elections from violence and corruption, I believe it demands greater
    vigor both in the enactment and in the execution of the laws framed
    for that purpose. Any oppression, any partisan partiality, which
    experience may have shown in the working of existing laws may well
    engage the careful attention both of Congress and of the Executive,
    in their respective spheres of duty, for the correction of these
    mischiefs. As no Congressional elections occur until after the regular
    session of Congress will have been held, there seems to be no public
    exigency that would preclude a seasonable consideration at that
    session of any administrative details that might improve the present
    methods designed for the protection of all citizens in the complete
    and equal exercise of the right and power of the suffrage at such
    elections. But with my views, both of the constitutionality and of the
    value of the existing laws, I can not approve any measure for their
    repeal except in connection with the enactment of other legislation
    which may reasonably be expected to afford wiser and more efficient
    safeguards for free and honest Congressional elections.

    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>June 23, 1879</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    After careful examination of the bill entitled "An act making
    appropriations for certain judicial expenses," I return it herewith
    to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, with the
    following objections to its approval:
</p>
<p>
    The general purpose of the bill is to provide for certain judicial
    expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880,
    for which the sum of $2,690,000 is appropriated. These appropriations
    are required to keep in operation the general functions of the
    judicial department of the Government, and if this part of the bill
    stood alone there would be no objection to its approval. It contains,
    however, other provisions, to which I desire respectfully to ask your
    attention.
</p>
<p>
    At the present session of Congress a majority of both Houses, favoring
    a repeal of the Congressional election laws embraced in title 26 of
    the Revised Statutes, passed a measure for that purpose, as part of
    a bill entitled "An act making appropriations for the legislative,
    executive, and judicial expenses of the Government for the fiscal year
    ending June 30, 1880, and for other purposes." Unable to concur with
    Congress in that measure, on the 29th of May last I returned the bill
    to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, without my
    approval, for that further consideration for which the Constitution
    provides. On reconsideration the bill was approved by less than
    two-thirds of the House, and failed to become a law. The election laws
    therefore remain valid enactments, and the supreme law of the land,
    binding not only upon all private citizens, but also alike and equally
    binding upon all who are charged with the duties and responsibilities
    of the legislative, the executive, and the judicial departments of the
    Government.
</p>
<p>
    It is not sought by the bill before me to repeal the election laws.
    Its object is to defeat their enforcement. The last clause of the
    first section is as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  And no part of the money hereby appropriated is appropriated
  to pay any salaries, compensation, fees, or expenses under
  or in virtue of title 26 of the Revised Statutes, or of any
  provision of said title.
</p>
<p>
    Title 26 of the Revised Statutes, referred to in the foregoing clause,
    relates to the elective franchise, and contains the laws now in force
    regulating the Congressional elections.
</p>
<p>
    The second section of the bill reaches much further. It is as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 2. That the sums appropriated in this act for the persons
  and public service embraced in its provisions are in full for
  such persons and public service for the fiscal year ending
  June 30, 1880; and no Department or officer of the Government
  shall during said fiscal year make any contract or incur any
  liability for the future payment of money under any of the
  provisions of title 26 of the Revised Statutes of the United
  States authorizing the appointment or payment of general
  or special deputy marshals for service in connection with
  elections or on election day until an appropriation sufficient
  to meet such contract or pay such liability shall have first
  been made by law.
</p>
<p>
    This section of the bill is intended to make an extensive and
    essential change in the existing laws. The following are the
    provisions of the statutes on the same subject which are now in force:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 3679. No Department of the Government shall expend in any
  one fiscal year any sum in excess of appropriations made by
  Congress for that fiscal year, or involve the Government in
  any contract for the future payment of money in excess of such
  appropriations.
</p><p class="q">
  SEC. 3732. No contract or purchase on behalf of the United
  States shall be made unless the same is authorized by law or
  is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment, except
  in the War and Navy Departments, for clothing, subsistence,
  forage, fuel, quarters, or transportation, which, however,
  shall not exceed the necessities of the current year.
</p>
<p>
    The object of these sections of the Revised Statutes is plain. It is,
    first, to prevent any money from being expended unless appropriations
    have been made therefor, and, second, to prevent the Government from
    being bound by any contract not previously authorized by law, except
    for certain necessary purposes in the War and Navy Departments.
</p>
<p>
    Under the existing laws the failure of Congress to make the
    appropriations required for the execution of the provisions of the
    election laws would not prevent their enforcement. The right and duty
    to appoint the general and special deputy marshals which they provide
    for would still remain, and the executive department of the Government
    would also be empowered to incur the requisite liability for
    their compensation. But the second section of this bill contains a
    prohibition not found in any previous legislation. Its design is to
    render the election laws inoperative and a dead letter during the
    next fiscal year. It is sought to accomplish this by omitting to
    appropriate money for their enforcement and by expressly prohibiting
    any Department or officer of the Government from incurring any
    liability under any of the provisions of title 26 of the Revised
    Statutes authorizing the appointment or payment of general or special
    deputy marshals for service on election days until an appropriation
    sufficient to pay such liability shall have first been made.
</p>
<p>
    The President is called upon to give his affirmative approval to
    positive enactments which in effect deprive him of the ordinary and
    necessary means of executing laws still left in the statute book
    and embraced within his constitutional duty to see that the laws are
    executed. If he approves the bill, and thus gives to such positive
    enactments the authority of law, he participates in the curtailment
    of his means of seeing that the law is faithfully executed, while
    the obligation of the law and of his constitutional duty remains
    unimpaired.
</p>
<p>
    The appointment of special deputy marshals is not made by the statute
    a spontaneous act of authority on the part of any executive or
    judicial officer of the Government, but is accorded as a popular right
    of the citizens to call into operation this agency for securing the
    purity and freedom of elections in any city or town having 20,000
    inhabitants or upward. Section 2021 of the Revised Statutes puts it in
    the power of any two citizens of such city or town to require of
    the marshal of the district the appointment of these special deputy
    marshals. Thereupon the duty of the marshal becomes imperative, and
    its nonperformance would expose him to judicial mandate or punishment
    or to removal from office by the President, as the circumstances of
    his conduct might require. The bill now before me neither revokes this
    popular right of the citizens, nor relieves the marshal of the duty
    imposed by law, nor the President of his duty to see that this law is
    faithfully executed.
</p>
<p>
    I forbear to enter again upon any general discussion of the wisdom
    and necessity of the election laws or of the dangerous and
    unconstitutional principle of this bill&mdash;that the power vested in
    Congress to originate appropriations involves the right to compel the
    Executive to approve any legislation which Congress may see fit to
    attach to such bills, under the penalty of refusing the means needed
    to carry on essential functions of the Government. My views on these
    subjects have been sufficiently presented in the special messages sent
    by me to the House of Representatives during their present session.
    What was said in those messages I regard as conclusive as to my
    duty in respect to the bill before me. The arguments urged in those
    communications against the repeal of the election laws and against
    the right of Congress to deprive the Executive of that separate and
    independent discretion and judgment which the Constitution confers and
    requires are equally cogent in opposition to this bill. This
    measure leaves the powers and duties of the supervisors of elections
    untouched. The compensation of those officers is provided for under
    permanent laws, and no liability for which an appropriation is now
    required would therefore be incurred by their appointment. But the
    power of the National Government to protect them in the discharge of
    their duty at the polls would be taken away. The States may employ
    both civil and military power at the elections, but by this bill even
    the civil authority to protect Congressional elections is denied to
    the United States. The object is to prevent any adequate control
    by the United States over the national elections by forbidding
    the payment of deputy marshals, the officers who are clothed with
    authority to enforce the election laws.
</p>
<p>
    The fact that these laws are deemed objectionable by a majority of
    both Houses of Congress is urged as a sufficient warrant for this
    legislation.
</p>
<p>
    There are two lawful ways to overturn legislative enactments. One
    is their repeal; the other is the decision of a competent tribunal
    against their validity. The effect of this bill is to deprive the
    executive department of the Government of the means to execute laws
    which are not repealed, which have not been declared invalid, and
    which it is therefore the duty of the executive and of every other
    department of Government to obey and to enforce.
</p>
<p>
    I have in my former message on this subject expressed a willingness
    to concur in suitable amendments for the improvement of the election
    laws; but I can not consent to their absolute and entire repeal, and I
    can not approve legislation which seeks to prevent their enforcement.

    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>June 30, 1879</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    I return to the House of Representatives, in which it originated,
    the bill entitled "An act making appropriations to pay fees of United
    States marshals and their general deputies," with the following
    objections to its becoming a law:
</p>
<p>
    The bill appropriates the sum of $600,000 for the payment during the
    fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, of United States marshals and their
    general deputies. The offices thus provided for are essential to the
    faithful execution of the laws. They were created and their powers and
    duties defined by Congress at its first session after the adoption of
    the Constitution in the judiciary act which was approved September
    24, 1789. Their general duties, as defined in the act which originally
    established them, were substantially the same as those prescribed in
    the statutes now in force.
</p>
<p>
    The principal provision on the subject in the Revised Statutes is as
    follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 787. It shall be the duty of the marshal of each district
  to attend the district and circuit courts when sitting
  therein, and to execute throughout the district all lawful
  precepts directed to him and issued under the authority of
  the United States; and he shall have power to command all
  necessary assistance in the execution of his duty.
</p>
<p>
    The original act was amended February 28, 1795, and the amendment is
    now found in the Revised Statutes in the following form:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 788. The marshals and their deputies shall have in each
  State the same powers in executing the laws of the United
  States as the sheriffs and their deputies in such State may
  have by law in executing the laws thereof.
</p>
<p>
    By subsequent statutes additional duties have been from time to time
    imposed upon the marshals and their deputies, the due and regular
    performance of which are required for the efficiency of almost every
    branch of the public service. Without these officers there would be
    no means of executing the warrants, decrees, or other process of
    the courts, and the judicial system of the country would be fatally
    defective. The criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the United
    States is very extensive. The crimes committed within the maritime
    jurisdiction of the United States are all cognizable only in the
    courts of the United States. Crimes against public justice; crimes
    against the operations of the Government, such as forging or
    counterfeiting the money or securities of the United States; crimes
    against the postal laws; offenses against the elective franchise,
    against the civil rights of citizens, against the existence of the
    Government; crimes against the internal-revenue laws, the customs
    laws, the neutrality laws; crimes against laws for the protection of
    Indians and of the public lands&mdash;all of these crimes and many others
    can be punished only under United States laws, laws which, taken
    together, constitute a body of jurisprudence which is vital to the
    welfare of the whole country, and which can be enforced only by means
    of the marshals and deputy marshals of the United States. In the
    District of Columbia all of the process of the courts is executed by
    the officers in question. In short, the execution of the criminal laws
    of the United States, the service of all civil process in cases in
    which the United States is a party, and the execution of the revenue
    laws, the neutrality laws, and many other laws of large importance
    depend on the maintenance of the marshals and their deputies. They are
    in effect the only police of the United States Government. Officers
    with corresponding powers and duties are found in every State of the
    Union and in every country which has a jurisprudence which is worthy
    of the name. To deprive the National Government of these officers
    would be as disastrous to society as to abolish the sheriffs,
    constables, and police officers in the several States. It would be a
    denial to the United States of the right to execute its laws&mdash;a
    denial of all authority which requires the use of civil force. The law
    entitles these officers to be paid. The funds needed for the purpose
    have been collected from the people and are now in the Treasury. No
    objection is, therefore, made to that part of the bill before me which
    appropriates money for the support of the marshals and deputy marshals
    of the United States.
</p>
<p>
    The bill contains, however, other provisions which are identical in
    tenor and effect with the second section of the bill entitled "An act
    making appropriations for certain judicial expenses," which on the 23d
    of the present month was returned to the House of Representatives
    with my objections to its approval. The provisions referred to are as
    follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 2. That the sums appropriated in this act for the persons
  and public service embraced in its provisions are in full for
  such persons and public service for the fiscal year ending
  June 30, 1880; and no Department or officer of the Government
  shall during said fiscal year make any contract or incur any
  liability for the future payment of money under any of the
  provisions of title 26 mentioned in section 1 of this act
  until an appropriation sufficient to meet such contract or pay
  such liability shall have first been made by law.
</p>
<p>
    Upon a reconsideration in the House of Representatives of the bill
    which contained these provisions it lacked a constitutional majority,
    and therefore failed to become a law. In order to secure its
    enactment, the same measure is again presented for my approval,
    coupled in the bill before me with appropriations for the support of
    marshals and their deputies during the next fiscal year. The object,
    manifestly, is to place before the Executive this alternative: Either
    to allow necessary functions of the public service to be crippled
    or suspended for want of the appropriations required to keep them in
    operation, or to approve legislation which in official communications
    to Congress he has declared would be a violation of his constitutional
    duty. Thus in this bill the principle is clearly embodied that by
    virtue of the provision of the Constitution which requires that
    "all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of
    Representatives" a bare majority of the House of Representatives has
    the right to withhold appropriations for the support of the Government
    unless the Executive consents to approve any legislation which may
    be attached to appropriation bills. I respectfully refer to the
    communications on this subject which I have sent to Congress during
    its present session for a statement of the grounds of my conclusions,
    and desire here merely to repeat that in my judgment to establish
    the principle of this bill is to make a radical, dangerous, and
    unconstitutional change in the character of our institutions.

    MY DEAR GENERAL: I congratulate you on your confirmation. It is a
    great gratification to me, very honorable to you, and will prove,
    I believe, of signal service to the country. My desire is that the
    office be conducted on strictly business principles, and according to
    the rules for the civil service which were recommended by the Civil
    Service Commission in the Administration of General Grant. I want
    you to be perfectly independent of mere influence from any quarter.
    Neither my recommendation, nor that of Secretary Sherman, nor of
    any member of Congress or other influential person must be specially
    regarded. Let appointments and removals be made on business principles
    and according to rules. There must be, I assume, a few places filled
    by those you personally know to be trustworthy, but restrict the area
    of patronage to the narrowest limits. Let no man be put out merely
    because he is a friend to Mr. Arthur, and no man put in merely because
    he is our friend. The good of the service should be the sole end in
    view. The best means yet presented, it seems to me, are the rules
    recommended by the Civil Service Commission. I shall issue no new
    order on the subject at present. I am glad you approve of the message,
    and I wish you to see that all that is expressed or implied in it is

    Regulations to Prevent the Introduction of the "Plague" into the

</p>
<p>
<i>To Officers of the Customs Revenue, Medical Officers of the
  Marine-Hospital Service, and others whom it may concern</i>:
</p>
<p>
    The act approved April 29, 1878, entitled "An act to prevent the
    introduction of contagious or infectious diseases into the United
    States," provides that no vessel coming from any foreign port or
    country where any contagious or infectious disease exists, nor any
    vessel conveying infected merchandise, shall enter any port of the
    United States or pass the boundary line between the United States and
    any foreign country except in such manner as may be prescribed under
    said act.
</p>
<p>
    Attention has been called to the prevalence of a dangerous epidemic
    disease in southern Russia known as the "plague," and its extremely
    virulent and contagious character, as manifested in the late outbreak,
    leaves no doubt that it is similar to, if not identical with, the
    "plague" which devastated the Old World in past centuries. Because,
    therefore, of the danger which attaches to rags, furs, etc., as
    carriers of infection, the following regulations are framed, under
    the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and subject to the
    approval of the President, for the protection of the health of the
    people of the United States against the danger referred to:
</p>
<p>
    Until further orders no vessel from any port of the Black Sea or the
    Sea of Azof, conveying any rags, furs, skins, hair, feathers, boxed
    or baled clothing or bedding, or any similar articles liable to convey
    infection, nor any vessel from any port of the Mediterranean or Red
    seas having on board such articles coming from southern Russia, shall
    enter any port of the United States until such articles shall have
    been removed from the vessel to open lighters or to some isolated
    locality and the vessel disinfected and thoroughly ventilated; and the
    suspected articles shall be disinfected, either by chemical agents and
    exposure to free currents of air or by burning, as shall be determined
    in each case by the Surgeon-General of the Marine-Hospital Service.
</p>
<p>
    The certificate of the State or municipal quarantine officer of health
    may be accepted as satisfactory evidence of compliance with these
    regulations on the part of the vessel.

</p>
<p>
Hon. JOHN SHERMAN,<br>
  <i>Secretary of the Treasury.</i>
</p>
<p>
    SIR: The President, by letter of 4th instant, having requested
    that appointments and promotions in this office should be made in
    accordance with the civil-service rules of 1872, and having also made
    a similar request of the naval officer, it has been deemed best to
    make, if practicable, the same rules applicable to all the offices
    in this city included in the order of the Treasury Department dated
    August 7, 1872.
</p>
<p>
    With that view, and after several conferences, it has been agreed
    by the assistant treasurer, naval officer, appraiser, surveyor, and
    myself to submit the inclosed modifications of the rules of 1872, and
    should they meet approval to put in operation forthwith the rules so
    modified.
</p>
<p>
    I am, very respectfully,
</p>
<p class="r">
    E.A. MERRITT,<br> <i>Collector.</i>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center>
    [The modifications submitted with the above letter are omitted,
    and instead are inserted the following regulations, based upon said
    modifications, approved by the President March 6, 1879, and amended
    with his approval in January, 1880.]
</center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center>
    Regulations Governing Appointments and Promotions in the Customs
    Service and Subtreasury in the City of New York.
</center>
<p>
    I. Every application for appointment to a vacancy in the lowest grade
    of any group in the offices of the collector and the surveyor of
    customs, the naval officer, the appraiser, and the assistant treasurer
    of the United States in the city of New York must be made in the
    handwriting of the applicant to the head of the office in which
    employment is desired. It must state: (1) The position to which the
    applicant desires to be appointed;<a href="#note-29"><small>29</small></a> (2) place and date of birth;
    (3) legal residence, and how long it has been such; (4) education; (5)
    occupation, past and present; (6) whether ever employed in the civil
    service, and, if so, when, how long, in what branch and capacity, and
    reasons for leaving the service; (7) whether ever in the Regular or
    Volunteer Army or Navy, and, if so, when and in what organization and
    capacity; (8) applicant's name in full.
</p>
<p>
    II. The applicant must certify to having composed and written the
    application without assistance; to the truth of the statements which
    it contains; to being a citizen of the United States, and faithful
    to the Union and the Constitution; and, if ever in the Regular or
    Volunteer Army or Navy, to having been honorably discharged.
</p>
<p>
    III. Every application must be accompanied by a certificate, signed by
    two trustworthy and responsible persons, well known in the community
    in which they reside, that the applicant is personally well known to
    them to be of good moral character and of temperate and industrious
    habits, and to be faithful to the Union and the Constitution of the
    United States.
</p>
<p>
    IV. Every application must also be accompanied by the certificate of a
    practicing physician as to the applicant's general health and physical
    capacity to perform the duties of the position to which he desires to
    be appointed: <i>Provided, however</i>, That no appointment will be made to
    any position in active outdoor service unless a surgeon of the United
    States Marine-Hospital Service shall certify that he has made a
    physical examination of the applicant and found him fit for such
    position. Such surgeon's examination may be postponed until required
    by the nominating officer.
</p>
<p>
    V. Applications filed previously to the adoption of these regulations
    must be renewed or perfected in accordance therewith to entitle them
    to consideration. No applications for appointment as day or night
    inspectors in the custom-house from persons under 21 years of age,
    or for other positions under these regulations from persons under 18
    years of age, will be considered. In compliance with section 1031 of
    the Treasury Regulations now in force, persons over 45 years of age
    are not eligible to any group the lowest grade of which is confined
    to persons receiving an annual salary of less than $1,800. This
    prohibition, however, shall not be applied to those who have been
    honorably discharged from the service and are otherwise qualified.
</p>
<p>
    VI. All applications upon their receipt will be carefully examined
    by the board of examiners, and those which do not conform in every
    particular to the foregoing requirements, and such as show that the
    applicants are manifestly not qualified for the duties of the position
    desired, will be rejected and the applicants so notified. All other
    applicants will be designated as eligible for examination, and will
    be so notified. Inasmuch as applications are to be made in writing and
    each case is to be decided upon its merits, personal importunity will
    have no weight.
</p>
<p>
    VII. Not less than five days prior to each examination a notification
    to appear at a time and place to be stated will be mailed to the
    eligible candidates, unless it shall be found impracticable to examine
    all of them, in which case a practicable number will be selected under
    the second regulation<a href="#note-30"><small>30</small></a> for the civil service promulgated April 16,
    1872, and notified to appear for examination. Those not selected for
    examination will remain on the eligible list. If any person notified
    to appear shall be unable to do so on account of sickness or other
    causes, he must promptly advise the board of examiners, in person or
    by mail, of his inability to attend, and his name will remain upon
    the eligible list; but any person attending an examination will not be
    allowed to subsequently plead sickness or other disabling causes as an
    excuse for defects in examination.
</p>
<p>
    VIII. All candidates for appointment to positions the annual salary
    of which is $1,200 or more, who shall appear in accordance with such
    notification, will be subjected to a competitive written examination
    upon the following subjects:
</p>
<p>
    (1) Copying from dictation; (2) arithmetic&mdash;fundamental rules,
    fractions, proportion, percentage and interest, reduction; (3)
    elements of accounts and bookkeeping; (4) geography, history, and
    government&mdash;general questions, principally such as relate to the
    United States; (5) elements of English grammar, chiefly orthography
    and syntax; (6) writing and briefing letters; and (7) penmanship.
</p>
<p>
    Candidates for appointment to positions the salary of which is
    less than $1,200 will be examined in like manner upon the following
    subjects: (1) Penmanship, (2) copying; (3) elements of English
    grammar, chiefly orthography and syntax; and (4) fundamental rules of
    arithmetic.
</p>
<p>
    Proficiency in penmanship, orthography, and punctuation will be
    determined principally by a review of the examination papers, and as
    far as possible the examination in all the branches will be confined
    to practical exercises.
</p>
<p>
    In examinations for appointments to positions requiring special
    or technical knowledge such additions may be made by the board of
    examiners to the list of subjects as the nature of the case may
    require.
</p>
<p>
    For temporary employment to meet casual exigencies in the public
    business, or for special services as experts, appointments may be made
    without examination; but no such appointment shall be made for a term
    exceeding three months, which may be specially extended for a similar
    term only; and no such appointment shall be made to any regular or
    permanent position.
</p>
<p>
    IX. The various subjects of the examination may be subdivided, if
    thought desirable, into classes, and to each subject or class a
    relative weight, according to its importance in the examination, will
    be assigned by each board of examiners. The mode of ascertaining the
    result of the examination will be as follows: The degree of accuracy
    with which each question shall be answered will first be marked by the
    board on a scale of 100. The average of the marks given to the answers
    to the questions in each subject or class will next be ascertained.
    Each average will then be multiplied by the number indicating the
    relative weight of the subject or class, and the sum of the products
    will be divided by the sum of the relative weights. The quotient will
    determine the candidate's standing in the examination. Relative weight
    will be assigned not merely to the special qualifications of the
    candidates, but to their general aptitude, as shown in the course of
    examination. Candidates will be examined during office hours, and in
    no case will their examination be continued more than one day.
</p>
<p>
    X. The board of examiners will prepare a list of the persons examined
    in the order of their excellence, as proved by such examination,
    beginning with the highest, and will then certify to the head of the
    office the names standing at the head of such list, not exceeding
    three. When more than one appointment is to be made, the vacancies
    will be numbered, and the first three names will be certified for
    the first vacancy, the remaining two and the fourth for the second
    vacancy, the remaining two and the fifth for the third vacancy, and so
    on for the whole number of vacancies; but if, after selecting one
    of any three certified for appointment, the head of the office shall
    object to another presentation of either of the remaining names, it
    shall not be again certified.
</p>
<p>
    XI. The examination papers of any candidate who shall have passed a
    minimum standard of 75 per cent, but who shall fail to be appointed,
    will, if requested by the candidate, be brought into competition with
    those candidates who shall compete for vacancies of the same class
    and nature occurring within one year: <i>Provided, however</i>, That the
    candidate shall not have been specially objected to by the head of
    the office under the last preceding regulation. No candidate who upon
    examination has been marked below the minimum will be allowed to again
    compete within one year from the date of such examination, unless for
    admission to a lower group.
</p>
<p>
    XII. All examination papers will be filed, and will at all times be
    open to the inspection of those interested, under such restrictions as
    may be imposed by the head of the office.
</p>
<p>
    XIII. There shall be one examining board for all appointments
    and promotions under these rules in the offices of the collector,
    surveyor, and naval officer, which shall consist of the surveyor and
    one representative to be nominated each by the collector and the
    naval officer, and three alternates, to be nominated one each by the
    collector, the naval officer, and the surveyor: <i>Provided, however</i>,
    That in examinations for positions in the surveyor's office the
    surveyor's alternate shall act on such board. The examining boards in
    the offices of the assistant treasurer and the appraiser shall consist
    of three persons, with three alternates, to be nominated by the
    assistant treasurer and the appraiser, respectively. All nominations
    as members and alternates on the examining boards shall be submitted
    to the Secretary of the Treasury for his approval. The heads of the
    several offices shall constitute a board of revision and appeal,
    which, upon appeal from any person examined or from any member of an
    examining board, shall revise the decision of said board.
</p>
<p>
    XIV. Whenever the head of an office shall notify the board of
    examiners for such office that a vacancy which he desires to fill
    exists in any grade above the lowest not excepted from the rules
    and regulations for the civil service, the board will fix a time for
    holding an examination for the purpose, and at least five days before
    the same is to take place will cause a notice to be posted in a
    conspicuous place in the office, stating the grade and group of the
    vacancy, the date of the examination, and that the vacancy is to be
    filled by a competitive examination of applicants from the next lower
    grade, unless none in such lower grade be found qualified, when those
    in the next lower grade may compete, or, if there be none in any of
    the lower grades qualified, competition will be open to applicants. In
    any examination for promotion, if the competitors from the next
    lower grade shall not exceed three in number, the board may, at its
    discretion, open the competition to the next lower grade or below, as
    they may deem best; and furthermore, if such promotion would probably
    occasion vacancies requiring other promotions, the board may combine
    in one the necessary examinations for such promotions. No person who
    has been examined in any grade for promotion and failed to receive
    such promotion shall again be admitted to examination within six
    months, but in the meantime his general average, as ascertained by
    such examination, may be brought into competition, as provided in
    Regulation XI.
</p>
<p>
    XV. The examination will be held upon the general subjects fixed for
    examinations for admission to the lowest grade of the group and upon
    such other subjects as the general nature of the business of the
    office and the special nature of the position to be filled may seem
    to the board of examiners to require. Due weight will be given to the
    efficiency with which the several candidates shall have previously
    performed their duties in the office; but no one who shall fail to
    pass a minimum standard of 75 per cent in the written examination will
    be certified for appointment.
</p>
<p>
    XVI. If no applicants from within the group shall be found competent,
    an examination will be held of all who shall make application in
    accordance with the regulations governing applications for admission
    to the office, after due public notice by the head of the office. The
    examination will be conducted in accordance with the provisions for
    admission to the office, as required by the fourth rule<a href="#note-31"><small>31</small></a> for the
    civil service promulgated December 19, 1871, but the nature of the
    examination will be the same as in any previous examination for the
    same vacancy.
</p>
<p>
    XVII. The list of names from which the appointment is to be made will
    be prepared and certified in the manner provided for admission to the
    lowest grade.
</p>
<p>
    XVIII. Persons employed in any of the offices to which these rules are
    applicable may be transferred without examination from one office to
    a grade no higher in another office, with, the consent of the heads
    of the respective offices and the approval of the Secretary of the
    Treasury.
</p>
<p>
    XIX. Under the provisions of rule 2<a href="#note-32"><small>32</small></a> of August 5, 1873, and the
    operation of these regulations, the power of suspension and of
    recommendation for discharge from the service shall remain with the
    nominating officer unrestricted. If, however, in his judgment it be
    deemed advisable, he may direct any person in his department to be
    cited before the regular examining board, and such board shall examine
    into and report upon the qualifications, efficiency, and general
    fitness for the position held, or for any position in the same or a
    lower grade, of the person so cited to appear; and furthermore, any
    person in the service engaged in active outdoor duties may be cited to
    appear before a surgeon of the United States Marine-Hospital Service
    and be examined by such surgeon as to the physical abilities of such
    person to perform the duties of the position occupied or of a position
    of less exposure, if otherwise qualified.
</p>
<p>
    XX. The sessions of the examining boards shall not be open to the
    public, but the board of revision and appeal may select such number
    of prominent citizens as may be deemed advisable, who shall have
    free access to the examining rooms, and who shall take no part in the
    conduct of the examination, but may, by inspection and inquiry,
    assure themselves regarding its thoroughness and impartiality, and may
    publicly certify the results of their inspection.

<p>

    RULES GOVERNING APPOINTMENT AND PROMOTION IN THE NEW YORK POST-OFFICE.
</center>
<p>
    For the purpose of making it more certain that only persons of
    good character and adequate capacity shall be selected from among
    applicants too numerous for the postmaster to become informed of their
    individual merits by personal investigation, the following rules are
    established:
</p>
<p>
    1. Hereafter all applications for clerical appointment at this
    post-office must be made in accordance with a prescribed form, a copy
    of which will be furnished to each applicant.
</p>
<p>
    2. All appointments to clerical positions will be made to the lowest
    grade, and no applications from persons under 16 or over 25 years of
    age will be entertained.
</p>
<p>
    3. On receipt of an application for appointment, and before further
    action is taken in regard to it, the applicant will be referred to the
    medical officer for examination as to his physical condition, as
    being adequate for the service; and if the report is unfavorable the
    application will be rejected. Should the report be favorable, the
    application will be filed and registered in its regular order.
</p>
<p>
    4. Every application must be accompanied by a certificate, signed by
    not less than three nor more than five reputable citizens, stating
    the time for which each has been acquainted with the applicant,
    and testifying to his good character and reputation for integrity,
    sobriety, and industry, and to the willingness of the signers to
    furnish personally any further information they may possess concerning
    the applicant, if so requested by the postmaster or the board of
    examiners.
</p>
<p>
    5. Applications not properly filled out as herein required, or which
    are found to contain false statements, or which in any other manner
    show the unfitness of the applicant for employment in the post-office,
    will be rejected and the applicant notified of such rejection.
</p>
<p>
    6. All examination papers, with the markings showing the relative
    proficiency of the candidates, will be carefully preserved and filed.
</p>
<p>
    7. The names of candidates which have been on the register for
    one year without being reached for examination will be regarded as
    removed, and will not be selected for examination unless again
    placed on the register by a new application, after which they will be
    selected when reached in order.
</p>
<p>
    8. All applications duly received and filed shall, when reached in
    order, be referred to a board of examiners, which is hereby appointed,
    and which shall consist of the assistant postmaster, auditor, the
    general superintendents of the fourth, fifth, and sixth divisions,
    and the assistant general superintendent of the third division. The
    postmaster's private secretary shall also act as secretary of said
    board.
</p>
<p>
    9. When vacancies occur in the lowest grade, the board of examiners
    shall notify such number of applicants, not less than twenty, of
    those first on the register of applicants to appear for a competitive
    examination.
</p>
<p>
    10. The questions to be asked and answered at such examinations shall
    be such as will show the relative proficiency of the candidates,
    first, in penmanship; second, in arithmetic; third, in geography;
    fourth, in English grammar; fifth, in the history of the United States
    and in matters of a public nature, to the extent that may be required
    adequately to test general capacity or special fitness for the postal
    service.
</p>
<p>
    11. The board shall present to the postmaster a list of the names of
    the successful candidates in the order of their excellence, as shown
    by the examination, beginning with the highest; and the appointments
    will be made from the three highest names on the list.
</p>
<p>
    12. All further details in methods of examination will be left to
    the discretion of the board, but subject to the instructions of the
    postmaster, in conformity herewith.
</p>
<p>
    13. All vacancies that may occur in the higher grades of any
    department shall be filled by promotion from the lower grades by means
    of competitive examinations, to which shall be admitted as competitors
    such persons only as are already employed in the division in which the
    vacancy exists or in divisions having analogous duties. The questions
    in these examinations shall be restricted mainly to matters pertaining
    to the ordinary business of that department. The examinations shall be
    conducted by the general superintendent of the division to which the
    department is attached, assisted by such one or more other officers
    of the same as the postmaster may select; and they shall report the
    result to the postmaster in the manner provided in rule 11, and the
    vacancy will be filled by the promotion of some one of the three
    standing highest in the competition. But whenever the vacancy to be
    filled by promotion is that of a position requiring the exercise of
    administrative authority the board may add such questions as will test
    the degree to which the candidates possess special qualifications for
    such position.
</p>
<p>
    14. For positions as porters the examination will be confined to
    questions intended to test the physical ability of the candidates and
    their proficiency in reading, penmanship, and elementary arithmetic
    only.
</p>
<p>
    15. The postmaster reserves from the operation of the above rules for
    original Appointment and promotion positions of especial pecuniary
    trust, as well as those involving confidential relations, as private
    secretary, etc.

<h2>
    THIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.
</h2>
<p class="r">
    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>December 1, 1879</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:</i>
</p>
<p>
    The members of the Forty-sixth Congress have assembled in their first
    regular session under circumstances calling for mutual congratulation
    and grateful acknowledgment to the Giver of All Good for the large and
    unusual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy.
</p>
<p>
    The most interesting events which have occurred in our public affairs
    since my last annual message to Congress are connected with the
    financial operations of the Government, directly affecting the
    business interests of the country. I congratulate Congress on the
    successful execution of the resumption act. At the time fixed, and
    in the manner contemplated by law, United States notes began to
    be redeemed in coin. Since the 1st of January last they have been
    promptly redeemed on presentation, and in all business transactions,
    public and private, in all parts of the country, they are received and
    paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon the Treasury
    for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been
    comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion
    in exchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious
    metals deposited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount
    of United States notes redeemed is about $40,000,000.
</p>
<p>
    The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great
    revival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the
    money of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal
    competition with other nations in trade and production. The increasing
    foreign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has
    caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in
    gold, from the 1st of July last to November 15, to the amount of about
    $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also
    been a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit. The
    bonds of the Government bearing only 4 per cent interest have been
    sold at or above par, sufficient in amount to pay off all of the
    national debt which was redeemable under present laws. The amount of
    interest saved annually by the process of refunding the debt since
    March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small
    sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities
    is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt
    which matures within less than two years is $792,121,700, of which
    $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent, and the balance
    is in bonds bearing 6 per cent interest. It is believed that this part
    of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of 4 per cent bonds,
    and, by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected, about
    $11,000,000 can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this
    important reduction of interest to be paid by the United States
    further legislation is required, which it is hoped will be provided by
    Congress during its present session.
</p>
<p>
    The coinage of gold by the mints of the United States during the last
    fiscal year was $40,986,912. The coinage of silver dollars since
    the passage of the act for that purpose up to November 1, 1879, was
    $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been issued from the Treasury
    and are now in circulation, and $32,300,506 are still in the
    possession of the Government.
</p>
<p>
    The pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the United
    States and the principal commercial nations of Europe to effect a
    permanent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized
    money of the world leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from
    new legislation on the general subject. The great revival of trade,
    internal and foreign, will supply during the coming year its own
    instructions, which may well be awaited before attempting further
    experimental measures with the coinage. I would, however, strongly
    urge upon Congress the importance of authorizing the Secretary of the
    Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the present
    legal ratio. The market value of the silver dollar being uniformly and
    largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously
    impracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both are
    coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation,
    it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of
    value, and thus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both
    gold and silver which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar,
    with the universally recognized money of the world.
</p>
<p>
    The retirement from circulation of United States notes with the
    capacity of legal tender in private contracts is a step to be taken
    in our progress toward a safe and stable currency which should be
    accepted as the policy and duty of the Government and the interest
    and security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issue of
    legal-tender paper money based wholly upon the authority and credit of
    the Government, except in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the
    Constitution and a violation of sound financial principles. The issue
    of United States notes during the late civil war with the capacity of
    legal tender between private individuals was not authorized except as
    a means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. The circulation
    of these notes as paper money for any protracted period of time after
    the accomplishment of this purpose was not contemplated by the
    framers of the law under which they were issued. They anticipated the
    redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable
    period consistent with the attainment of the object for which they
    were provided.
</p>
<p>
    The policy of the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption
    of the Constitution, has been to avoid the creation of a national
    debt; and when, from necessity in time of war, debts have been
    created, they have been paid off, on the return of peace, as rapidly
    as possible. With this view, and for this purpose, it is recommended
    that the existing laws for the accumulation of a sinking fund
    sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period
    be maintained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is
    deemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has
    shown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee which will not
    enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will
    add several millions of dollars annually to the Treasury.
</p>
<p>
    The continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent
    and influential citizens of the Territory of Utah of the laws of the
    United States for the prosecution and punishment of polygamy demands
    the attention of every department of the Government. This Territory
    has a population sufficient to entitle it to admission as a State,
    and the general interests of the nation, as well as the welfare of the
    citizens of the Territory, require its advance from the Territorial
    form of government to the responsibilities and privileges of a State.
    This important change will not, however, be approved by the country
    while the citizens of Utah in very considerable number uphold a
    practice which is condemned as a crime by the laws of all civilized
    communities throughout the world.
</p>
<p>
    The law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with great
    unanimity by Congress more than seventeen years ago, but has remained
    until recently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah, because of the
    peculiar difficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely
    prevailed among the citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention
    of the constitutional guaranty of religious freedom. This objection
    is now removed. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided the
    law to be within the legislative power of Congress and binding as a
    rule of action for all who reside within the Territories. There is
    no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement.
    It should be firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently
    stringent in its provisions, it should be amended; and in aid of the
    purpose in view I recommend that more comprehensive and more searching
    methods for preventing as well as punishing this crime be provided. If
    necessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exercise
    of the rights and privileges of citizenship in the Territories of the
    United States may be withheld or withdrawn from those who violate or
    oppose the enforcement of the law on this subject.
</p>
<p>
    The elections of the past year, though occupied only with State
    officers, have not failed to elicit in the political discussions which
    attended them all over the country new and decisive evidence of the
    deep interest which the great body of citizens take in the progress
    of the country toward a more general and complete establishment, at
    whatever cost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of
    the elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand
    great attention from our people, both in the sphere of national and
    State authority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed
    in my last annual message, that no temporary or administrative
    interests of government, however urgent or weighty, will ever
    displace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of
    citizenship, and that the power of public opinion will override all
    political prejudices, and all sectional and State attachments in
    demanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of
    citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing and
    carry with them unchallenged security and respect. I earnestly appeal
    to the intelligence and patriotism of all good citizens of every part
    of the country, however much they may be divided in opinions on other
    political subjects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws
    aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge
    upon Congress to supply any defects in these laws which experience has
    shown and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke the
    cooperation of the executive and legislative authorities of the States
    in this great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind
    can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular rights no
    serious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacification of the
    country or retard the general diffusion of prosperity.
</p>
<p>
    In a former message I invited the attention of Congress to the
    subject of the reformation of the civil service of the Government,
    and expressed the intention of transmitting to Congress as early as
    practicable a report upon this subject by the chairman of the Civil
    Service Commission.
</p>
<p>
    In view of the facts that during a considerable period the Government
    of Great Britain has been dealing with administrative problems and
    abuses in various particulars analogous to those presented in this
    country, and that in recent years the measures adopted were understood
    to have been effective and in every respect highly satisfactory, I
    thought it desirable to have fuller information upon the subject, and
    accordingly requested the chairman of the Civil Service Commission to
    make a thorough investigation for this purpose. The result has been an
    elaborate and comprehensive report.
</p>
<p>
    The report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system
    in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary
    patronage, and of official interference with the freedom of elections.
    It shows that after long trials of various kinds of examinations those
    which are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are
    carried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have,
    with great advantage, been established as conditions of admission to
    almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that
    country and of British India. The completion of the report, owing to
    the extent of the labor involved in its preparation and the omission
    of Congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the
    expenses of the Commission, has been postponed until the present time.
    It is herewith transmitted to Congress.
</p>
<p>
    While the reform measures of another government are of no authority
    for us, they are entitled to influence to the extent to which their
    intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our institutions and
    social life may commend them to our consideration. The views I have
    heretofore expressed concerning the defects and abuses in our civil
    administration remain unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged
    experience has deepened my sense of the duty both of officers and of
    the people themselves to cooperate for their removal. The grave evils
    and perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment to office and of
    office tenure are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of
    the great parties, in the reports of Departments, in the debates and
    proceedings of Congress, in the messages of Executives, the gravity of
    these evils has been pointed out and the need of their reform has been
    admitted.
</p>
<p>
    To command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be
    based on common right and justice, and must be compatible with the
    healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essential
    in a free state.
</p>
<p>
    When the people have approved a policy at a national election,
    confidence on the part of the officers they have selected and of the
    advisers who, in accordance with our political institutions, should be
    consulted in the policy which it is their duty to carry into effect
    is indispensable. It is eminently proper that they should explain it
    before the people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the performance
    of their official duties.
</p>
<p>
    Very different considerations apply to the greater number of those who
    fill the subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility
    is to their superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey
    the legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved,
    and their best public service consists in the discharge of their
    functions irrespective of partisan politics. Their duties are the
    same whatever party is in power and whatever policy prevails. As a
    consequence it follows that their tenure of office should not depend
    on the prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of any party, but
    should be determined by their capacity to serve the people most
    usefully quite irrespective of partisan interests. The same
    considerations that should govern the tenure should also prevail in
    the appointment, discipline, and removal of these subordinates. The
    authority of appointment and removal is not a perquisite, which may
    be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is a trust, to be
    exercised in the public interest under all the sanctions which attend
    the obligation to apply the public funds only for public purposes.
</p>
<p>
    Every citizen has an equal right to the honor and profit of
    entering the public service of his country. The only just ground of
    discrimination is the measure of character and capacity he has to make
    that service most useful to the people. Except in cases where,
    upon just and recognized principles&mdash;as upon the theory of
    pensions&mdash;offices and promotions are bestowed as rewards for past
    services, their bestowal upon any theory which disregards personal
    merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breach of
    that trust subject to which the appointing power is held.
</p>
<p>
    In the light of these principles it becomes of great importance to
    provide just and adequate means, especially for every Department and
    large administrative office, where personal discrimination on the part
    of its head is not practicable, for ascertaining those qualifications
    to which appointments and removals should have reference. To fail to
    provide such means is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining
    the facts upon which the most righteous claim to office depends,
    but of necessity to discourage all worthy aspirants by handing over
    appointments and removals to mere influence and favoritism. If it is
    the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appointment and the
    interest of the people to bestow it upon him, it would seem clear that
    a wise and just method of ascertaining personal fitness for office
    must be an important and permanent function of every just and wise
    government. It has long since become impossible in the great offices
    for those having the duty of nomination and appointment to personally
    examine into the individual qualifications of more than a small
    proportion of those seeking office, and with the enlargement of the
    civil service that proportion must continue to become less.
</p>
<p>
    In the earlier years of the Government the subordinate offices were so
    few in number that it was quite easy for those making appointments
    and promotions to personally ascertain the merits of candidates.
    Party managers and methods had not then become powerful agencies of
    coercion, hostile to the free and just exercise of the appointing
    power.
</p>
<p>
    A large and responsible part of the duty of restoring the civil
    service to the desired purity and efficiency rests upon the President,
    and it is my purpose to do what is within my power to advance such
    prudent and gradual measures of reform as will most surely and rapidly
    bring about that radical change of system essential to make our
    administrative methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people.
    By a proper exercise of authority it is in the power of the Executive
    to do much to promote such a reform. But it can not be too clearly
    understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without
    cooperation on the part of Congress and considerate and intelligent
    support among the people. Reforms which challenge the generally
    accepted theories of parties and demand changes in the methods of
    Departments are not the work of a day. Their permanent foundations
    must be laid in sound principles and in an experience which
    demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors of their adversaries.
    Every worthy officer desires to make his official action a gain and an
    honor to his country; but the people themselves, far more than their
    officers in public station, are interested in a pure, economical, and
    vigorous administration.
</p>
<p>
    By laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, and now in substance incorporated
    in the Revised Statutes, the practice of arbitrary appointments to the
    several subordinate grades in the great Departments was condemned, and
    examinations as to capacity, to be conducted by departmental boards of
    examiners, were provided for and made conditions of admission to
    the public service. These statutes are a decision by Congress that
    examinations of some sort as to attainments and capacity are essential
    to the well-being of the public service. The important questions since
    the enactment of these laws have been as to the character of these
    examinations, and whether official favor and partisan influence or
    common right and merit were to control the access to the examinations.
    In practice these examinations have not always been open to worthy
    persons generally who might wish to be examined. Official favoritism
    and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those
    who alone were permitted to go before the examining boards, subjecting
    even the examiners to a pressure from the friends of the candidates
    very difficult to resist. As a consequence the standard of admission
    fell below that which the public interest demanded. It was also almost
    inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards of
    examiners, with no common supervision or uniform method of procedure,
    should result in confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests of
    capacity, highly detrimental to the public interest. A further and
    more radical change was obviously required.
</p>
<p>
    In the annual message of December, 1870, my predecessor declared
    that&mdash;
</p>
<p class="q">
  There is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and
  heads of Departments as that of appointments, nor is there
  any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators and
  Representatives as that of finding places for constituents.
  The present system does not secure the best men, and often not
  even fit men, for public place. The elevation and purification
  of the civil service of the Government will be hailed with
  approval by the whole people of the United States.
</p>
<p>
    Congress accordingly passed the act approved March 3, 1871, "to
    regulate the civil service of the United States and promote the
    efficiency thereof," giving the necessary authority to the Executive
    to inaugurate a civil-service reform.
</p>
<p>
    Acting under this statute, which was interpreted as intended to secure
    a system of just and effectual examinations under uniform supervision,
    a number of eminently competent persons were selected for the purpose,
    who entered with zeal upon the discharge of their duties, prepared
    with an intelligent appreciation of the requirements of the service
    the regulations contemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and
    who in their capacity as a board have been known as the "Civil Service
    Commission." Congress for two years appropriated the money needed for
    the compensation and for the expense of carrying on the work of the
    Commission.
</p>
<p>
    It appears from the report of the Commission submitted to the
    President in April, 1874, that examinations had been held in various
    sections of the country, and that an appropriation of about $25,000
    would be required to meet the annual expenses, including salaries,
    involved in discharging the duties of the Commission. The report was
    transmitted to Congress by special message of April 18, 1874, with the
    following favorable comment upon the labors of the Commission:
</p>
<p class="q">
  If sustained by Congress, I have no doubt the rules can, after
  the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as to still
  more materially benefit the public service and relieve the
  Executive, members of Congress, and the heads of Departments
  from influences prejudicial to good administration. The
  rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, have resulted
  beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of the members of
  the Cabinet and their subordinates in the Departments, and in
  that opinion I concur.
</p>
<p>
    And in the annual message of December of the same year similar views
    are expressed and an appropriation for continuing the work of the
    Commission again advised.
</p>
<p>
    The appropriation was not made, and as a consequence the active work
    of the Commission was suspended, leaving the Commission itself still
    in existence. Without the means, therefore, of causing qualifications
    to be tested in any systematic manner or of securing for the public
    service the advantages of competition upon any extensive plan, I
    recommended in my annual message of December, 1877, the making of an
    appropriation for the resumption of the work of the Commission.
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, however, competitive examinations, under many
    embarrassments, have been conducted within limited spheres in
    the Executive Departments in Washington and in a number of the
    custom-houses and post-offices of the principal cities of the country,
    with a view to further test their effects, and in every instance they
    have been found to be as salutary as they are stated to have been
    under the Administration of my predecessor. I think the economy,
    purity, and efficiency of the public service would be greatly promoted
    by their systematic introduction, wherever practicable, throughout the
    entire civil service of the Government, together with ample provision
    for their general supervision in order to secure consistency and
    uniform justice.
</p>
<p>
    Reports from the Secretary of the Interior, from the
    Postmaster-General, from the postmaster in the city of New York, where
    such examinations have been some time on trial, and also from the
    collector of the port, the naval officer, and the surveyor in that
    city, and from the postmasters and collectors in several of the other
    large cities, show that the competitive system, where applied, has in
    various ways contributed to improve the public service.
</p>
<p>
    The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked
    degree, and that the general application of similar rules can not fail
    to be of decided benefit to the service.
</p>
<p>
    The reports of the Government officers, in the city of New York
    especially, bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive
    examinations in their respective offices, showing that&mdash;
</p>
<p class="q">
  These examinations and the excellent qualifications of
  those admitted to the service through them have had a marked
  incidental effect upon the persons previously in the service,
  and particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has
  been on the part of these latter an increased interest in the
  work and a desire to extend acquaintance with it beyond the
  particular desk occupied, and thus the morale of the entire
  force has been raised. * * * The examinations have been
  attended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to
  thoroughly investigate the scope and character of the tests
  and the method of determining the results, and those visitors
  have without exception approved the methods employed, and
  several of them have publicly attested their favorable
  opinion.
</p>
<p>
    Upon such considerations I deem it my duty to renew the recommendation
    contained in my annual message of December, 1877, requesting Congress
    to make the necessary appropriation for the resumption of the work of
    the Civil Service Commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing
    a moderate compensation to persons in the public service who may
    perform extra labor upon or under the Commission, as the Executive may
    direct.
</p>
<p>
    I am convinced that if a just and adequate test of merit is enforced
    for admission to the public service and in making promotions such
    abuses as removals without good cause and partisan and official
    interference with the proper exercise of the appointing power will in
    large measure disappear.
</p>
<p>
    There are other administrative abuses to which the attention
    of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan
    appointments and the constant peril of removal without cause very
    naturally lead to an absorbing and mischievous political activity on
    the part of those thus appointed, which not only interferes with the
    due discharge of official duty, but is incompatible with the freedom
    of elections. Not without warrant in the views of several of my
    predecessors in the Presidential office, and directly within the law
    of 1871, already cited, I endeavored, by regulation made on the 22d
    day of June, 1877, to put some reasonable limits to such abuses. It
    may not be easy, and it may never perhaps be necessary, to define with
    precision the proper limit of political action on the part of Federal
    officers. But while their right to hold and freely express their
    opinions can not be questioned, it is very plain that they should
    neither be allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the
    proper discharge of their official duties nor to use the authority of
    their office to enforce their own opinions or to coerce the political
    action of those who hold different opinions.
</p>
<p>
    Reasons of justice and public policy quite analogous to those which
    forbid the use of official power for the oppression of the private
    citizen impose upon the Government the duty of protecting its officers
    and agents from arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered,
    the practice of making levies for party purposes upon the salaries
    of officers is highly demoralizing to the public service and
    discreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free as
    any other citizen to give his own money in aid of his opinions or his
    party, he should also be as free as any other citizen to refuse to
    make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for the time
    and labor of the officer, it is gross injustice to levy a tax upon
    them. If they are made excessive in order that they may bear the tax,
    the excess is an indirect robbery of the public funds.
</p>
<p>
    I recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present
    statutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or
    public employment the protection with which a great and enlightened
    nation should guard those who are faithful in its service.
</p>
<p>
    Our relations with foreign countries have continued peaceful.
</p>
<p>
    With Great Britain there are still unsettled questions, growing out of
    the local laws of the maritime provinces and the action of provincial
    authorities deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty
    to American fishermen. The United States minister in London has been
    instructed to present a demand for $105,305.02 in view of the damages
    received by American citizens at Fortune Bay on the 6th day of
    January, 1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the
    British Government, and an early reply is anticipated.
</p>
<p>
    Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary examinations the
    subject of our participation in the provincial fisheries, as regulated
    by treaty, will at once be brought to the attention of the British
    Government, with a view to an early and permanent settlement of the
    whole question, which was only temporarily adjusted by the treaty of
    Washington.
</p>
<p>
    Efforts have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions found
    injurious to the exportation of cattle to the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
    Some correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and
    saving of life and property upon the Lakes, which has resulted in
    important modifications of the previous regulations of the Dominion
    government on the subject in the interest of humanity and commerce.
</p>
<p>
    In accordance with the joint resolution of the last session of
    Congress, commissioners were appointed to represent the United States
    at the two international exhibitions in Australia, one of which is
    now in progress at Sydney, and the other to be held next year
    at Melbourne. A desire has been expressed by our merchants and
    manufacturers interested in the important and growing trade with
    Australia that an increased provision should be made by Congress for
    the representation of our industries at the Melbourne exhibition of
    next year, and the subject is respectfully submitted to your favorable
    consideration.
</p>
<p>
    The assent of the Government has been given to the landing on the
    coast of Massachusetts of a new and independent transatlantic cable
    between France, by way of the French island of St. Pierre, and this
    country, subject to any future legislation of Congress on the subject.
    The conditions imposed before allowing this connection with our shores
    to be established are such as to secure its competition with any
    existing or future lines of marine cable and preclude amalgamation
    therewith, to provide for entire equality of rights to our Government
    and people with those of France in the use of the cable, and prevent
    any exclusive possession of the privilege as accorded by France to the
    disadvantage of any future cable communication between France and the
    United States which may be projected and accomplished by our citizens.
    An important reduction of the present rates of cable communication
    with Europe, felt to be too burdensome to the interests of our
    commerce, must necessarily flow from the establishment of this
    competing line.
</p>
<p>
    The attention of Congress was drawn to the propriety of some general
    regulation by Congress of the whole subject of transmarine cables by
    my predecessor in his message of December 7, 1875, and I respectfully
    submit to your consideration the importance of Congressional action in
    the matter.
</p>
<p>
    The questions of grave importance with Spain growing out of the
    incidents of the Cuban insurrection have been for the most part
    happily and honorably settled. It may reasonably be anticipated that
    the commission now sitting in Washington for the decision of private
    cases in this connection will soon be able to bring its labors to a
    conclusion.
</p>
<p>
    The long-standing question of East Florida claims has lately been
    renewed as a subject of correspondence, and may possibly require
    Congressional action for its final disposition.
</p>
<p>
    A treaty with the Netherlands with respect to consular rights and
    privileges similar to those with other powers has been signed and
    ratified, and the ratifications were exchanged on the 31st of July
    last. Negotiations for extradition treaties with the Netherlands and
    with Denmark are now in progress.
</p>
<p>
    Some questions with Switzerland in regard to pauper and convict
    emigrants have arisen, but it is not doubted that they will be
    arranged upon a just and satisfactory basis. A question has also
    occurred with respect to an asserted claim by Swiss municipal
    authorities to exercise tutelage over persons and property of Swiss
    citizens naturalized in this country. It is possible this may require
    adjustment by treaty.
</p>
<p>
    With the German Empire frequent questions arise in connection with
    the subjects of naturalization and expatriation, but the Imperial
    Government has constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and
    comply with all treaty stipulations in regard to them.
</p>
<p>
    In consequence of the omission of Congress to provide for a diplomatic
    representative at Athens, the legation to Greece has been withdrawn.
    There is now no channel of diplomatic communication between the two
    countries, and the expediency of providing for one in some form is
    submitted to Congress.
</p>
<p>
    Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium
    continue amicable, and marked by no incident of especial importance.
</p>
<p>
    A change of the personal head of the Government of Egypt has taken
    place. No change, however, has occurred in the relations between
    Egypt and the United States. The action of the Egyptian Government in
    presenting to the city of New York one of the ancient obelisks, which
    possess such historic interest, is highly appreciated as a generous
    mark of international regard. If prosperity should attend the
    enterprise of its transportation across the Atlantic, its erection in
    a conspicuous position in the chief commercial city of the nation will
    soon be accomplished.
</p>
<p>
    The treaty recently made between Japan and the United States in regard
    to the revision of former commercial treaties it is now believed will
    be followed by similar action on the part of other treaty powers. The
    attention of Congress is again invited to the subject of the indemnity
    funds received some years since from Japan and China, which, with
    their accumulated interest, now amount to considerable sums. If any
    part of these funds is justly due to American citizens, they should
    receive it promptly; and whatever may have been received by this
    Government in excess of strictly just demands should in some form be
    returned to the nations to whom it equitably belongs.
</p>
<p>
    The Government of China has signified its willingness to consider the
    question of the emigration of its subjects to the United States with
    a dispassionate fairness and to cooperate in such measures as may
    tend to prevent injurious consequences to the United States. The
    negotiations are still proceeding, and will be pressed with diligence.
</p>
<p>
    A question having arisen between China and Japan about the Lew Chew
    Islands, the United States Government has taken measures to inform
    those powers of its readiness to extend its good offices for the
    maintenance of peace if they shall mutually deem it desirable and find
    it practicable to avail themselves of the proffer.
</p>
<p>
    It is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the
    judicious and energetic action of the military commanders of the two
    nations on each side of the Rio Grande, under the instructions of
    their respective Governments, raids and depredations have greatly
    decreased, and in the localities where formerly most destructive
    have now almost wholly ceased. In view of this result, I entertain a
    confident expectation that the prevalence of quiet on the border will
    soon become so assured as to justify a modification of the present
    orders to our military commanders as to crossing the border, without
    encouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of the two
    countries.
</p>
<p>
    The third installment of the award against Mexico under the claims
    commission of July 4, 1868, was duly paid, and has been put in course
    of distribution in pursuance of the act of Congress providing for the
    same. This satisfactory situation between the two countries leads me
    to anticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexico and an increased
    contribution of capital and industry by our people to the development
    of the great resources of that country. I earnestly commend to the
    wisdom of Congress the provision of suitable legislation looking to
    this result.
</p>
<p>
    Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is again fully restored by the
    arrival of a minister from that country to the United States. This
    is especially fortunate in view of the fact that the question of an
    interoceanic canal has recently assumed a new and important aspect and
    is now under discussion with the Central American countries through
    whose territory the canal, by the Nicaragua route, would have to pass.
    It is trusted that enlightened statesmanship on their part will see
    that the early prosecution of such a work will largely inure to
    the benefit, not only of their own citizens and those of the United
    States, but of the commerce of the civilized world. It is not doubted
    that should the work be undertaken under the protective auspices of
    the United States, and upon satisfactory concessions for the right of
    way and its security by the Central American Governments, the capital
    for its completion would be readily furnished from this country and
    Europe, which might, failing such guaranties, prove inaccessible.
</p>
<p>
    Diplomatic relations with Chile have also been strengthened by the
    reception of a minister from that country.
</p>
<p>
    The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chile still continues. The United
    States have not deemed it proper to interpose in the matter further
    than to convey to all the Governments concerned the assurance that
    the friendly offices of the Government of the United States for the
    restoration of peace upon an honorable basis will be extended in case
    the belligerents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them.
</p>
<p>
    Cordial relations continue with Brazil and the Argentine Republic, and
    trade with those countries is improving. A provision for regular and
    more frequent mail communication, in our own ships, between the
    ports of this country and the nations of South America seems to me
    to deserve the attention of Congress as an essential precursor of an
    enlargement of our commerce with them and an extension of our carrying
    trade.
</p>
<p>
    A recent revolution in Venezuela has been followed by the
    establishment of a provisional government. This government has not
    yet been formally recognized, and it is deemed desirable to await
    the proposed action of the people which is expected to give it the
    sanction of constitutional forms.
</p>
<p>
    A naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan Islands to make surveys and
    take possession of the privileges ceded to the United States by Samoa
    in the harbor of Pago-Pago. A coaling station is to be established
    there, which will be convenient and useful to United States vessels.
</p>
<p>
    The subject of opening diplomatic relations with Roumania and
    Servia, now become independent sovereignties, is at present under
    consideration, and is the subject of diplomatic correspondence.
</p>
<p>
    There is a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all European and
    American countries, and it is believed that with judicious action in
    regard to its development it can and will be still more enhanced and
    that American products and manufactures will find new and expanding
    markets. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers upon this
    subject, under the system now adopted, have resulted in obtaining
    much valuable information, which has been and will continue to be laid
    before Congress and the public from time to time.
</p>
<p>
    The third article of the treaty with Russia of March 30, 1867,
    by which Alaska was ceded to the United States, provides that
    the inhabitants of the ceded territory, with the exception of the
    uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all
    the rights of citizens of the United States and shall be maintained
    and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property,
    and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to such laws and
    regulations as the United States may from time to time adopt in regard
    to the aboriginal tribes of that country.
</p>
<p>
    Both the obligations of this treaty and the necessities of the people
    require that some organized form of government over the Territory of
    Alaska be adopted.
</p>
<p>
    There appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged with
    common-law offenses, such as assault, robbery, and murder, and no
    magistrate authorized to issue or execute process in such cases.
    Serious difficulties have already arisen from offenses of this
    character, not only among the original inhabitants, but among citizens
    of the United States and other countries who have engaged in mining,
    fishing, and other business operations within the territory. A bill
    authorizing the appointment of justices of the peace and constables
    and the arrest and detention of persons charged with criminal
    offenses, and providing for an appeal to United States courts for
    the district of Oregon in suitable cases, will at a proper time be
    submitted to Congress.
</p>
<p>
    The attention of Congress is called to the annual report of the
    Secretary of the Treasury on the condition of the public finances.
</p>
<p>
    The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June
    30, 1879, were $273,827,184.46; the ordinary expenditures for the same
    period were $266,947,883.53, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of
    $6,879,300.93.
</p>
<p>
    The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, actual
    and estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter,
    commencing July 1, 1879, $79,843,663.61; estimated receipts for the
    remaining three quarters of the year, $208,156,336.39; total receipts
    for the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $288,000,000.
</p>
<p>
    The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as
    follows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1879, actual expenditures,
    $91,683,385.10; and for the remaining three quarters of the year
    the expenditures are estimated at $172,316,614.90, making the total
    expenditures $264,000,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue
    for the year ending June 30, 1880, of $24,000,000. The total receipts
    during the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1881, estimated according
    to existing laws, will be $288,000,000, and the estimated ordinary
    expenditures for the same period will be $278,097,364.39, leaving a
    surplus of $9,902,635.61 for that year.
</p>
<p>
    The large amount expended for arrears of pensions during the last and
    the present fiscal year, amounting to $21,747,249.60, has prevented
    the application of the full amount required by law to the sinking
    fund for the current year; but these arrears having been substantially
    paid, it is believed that the sinking fund can hereafter be maintained
    without any change of existing law.
</p>
<p>
    The Secretary of War reports that the War Department estimates for the
    fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $40,380,428.93, the same being
    for a less sum of money than any annual estimate rendered to Congress
    from that Department during a period of at least twelve years.
</p>
<p>
    He concurs with the General of the Army in recommending such
    legislation as will authorize the enlistment of the full number
    of 25,000 men for the line of the Army, exclusive of the 3,463 men
    required for detached duty, and therefore not available for service in
    the field.
</p>
<p>
    He also recommends that Congress be asked to provide by law for
    the disposition of a large number of abandoned military posts and
    reservations, which, though very valuable in themselves, have been
    rendered useless for military purposes by the advance of civilization
    and settlement.
</p>
<p>
    He unites with the Quartermaster-General in recommending that an
    appropriation be made for the construction of a cheap and perfectly
    fireproof building for the safe storage of a vast amount of money
    accounts, vouchers, claims, and other valuable records now in the
    Quartermaster-General's Office, and exposed to great risk of total
    destruction by fire.
</p>
<p>
    He also recommends, in conformity with the views of the
    Judge-Advocate-General, some declaratory legislation in reference
    to the military statute of limitations as applied to the crime of
    desertion.
</p>
<p>
    In these several recommendations I concur.
</p>
<p>
    The Secretary of War further reports that the work for the improvement
    of the South Pass of the Mississippi River, under contract with Mr.
    James B. Eads, made in pursuance of an act of Congress, has been
    prosecuted during the past year with a greater measure of success in
    the attainment of results than during any previous year. The channel
    through the South Pass, which at the beginning of operations in June,
    1875, had a depth of only 7-1/2 feet of water, had on the 8th of July,
    1879, a minimum depth of 26 feet, having a width of not less than
    200 feet and a central depth of 30 feet. Payments have been made in
    accordance with the statute, as the work progressed, amounting in
    the aggregate to $4,250,000; and further payments will become due, as
    provided by the statute, in the event of success in maintaining the
    channel now secured.
</p>
<p>
    The reports of the General of the Army and of his subordinates
    present a full and detailed account of the military operations for
    the suppression of hostilities among the Indians of the Ute and
    Apache tribes, and praise is justly awarded to the officers and troops
    engaged for promptness, skill, and courage displayed.
</p>
<p>
    The past year has been one of almost unbroken peace and quiet on the
    Mexican frontier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts of
    this Government and of Mexico to maintain order in that region will
    prove permanently successful.
</p>
<p>
    This Department was enabled during the past year to find temporary,
    though crowded, accommodations and a safe depository for a portion of
    its records in the completed east wing of the building designed for
    the State, War, and Navy Departments. The construction of the north
    wing of the building, a part of the structure intended for the use
    of the War Department, is being carried forward with all possible
    dispatch, and the work should receive from Congress such liberal
    appropriations as will secure its speedy completion.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows continued improvement
    in that branch of the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive
    repairs have been made upon vessels, and two new ships have been
    completed and made ready for sea.
</p>
<p>
    The total expenditures of the year ended June 30, 1879, including
    specific appropriations not estimated for by the Department, were
    $13,555,710.09. The expenses chargeable to the year, after deducting
    the amount of these specific appropriations, were $13,343,317.79; but
    this is subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been
    drawn upon warrants, but not paid out during the year. The amount of
    appropriations applicable to the last fiscal year was $14,538,646.17.
    There was, therefore, a balance of $1,479,054.37 remaining unexpended
    and to the credit of the Department on June 30, 1879. The estimates
    for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $14,864,147.95, which
    exceeds the appropriations for the present fiscal year $361,897.28.
    The reason for this increase is explained in the Secretary's
    report. The appropriations available for the present fiscal year are
    $14,502,250.67, which will, in the opinion of the Secretary, answer
    all the ordinary demands of the service. The amount drawn from the
    Treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1879 was $5,770,404.12, of which
    $1,095,440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that
    period $4,674,963.79. If the expenditures of the remaining two-thirds
    of the year do not exceed the proportion for these four months, there
    will remain unexpended at the end of the year $477,359.30 of the
    current appropriations. The report of the Secretary shows the
    gratifying fact that among all the disbursing officers of the Pay
    Corps of the Navy there is not one who is a defaulter to the extent of
    a single dollar. I unite with him in recommending the removal of the
    observatory to a more healthful location. That institution reflects
    credit upon the nation, and has obtained the approbation of scientific
    men in all parts of the world. Its removal from its present location
    would not only be conducive to the health of its officers and
    professors, but would greatly increase its usefulness.
</p>
<p>
    The appropriation for judicial expenses, which has heretofore been
    made for the Department of Justice in gross, was subdivided at the
    last session of Congress, and no appropriation whatever was made for
    the payment of the fees of marshals and their deputies, either in the
    service of process or for the discharge of other duties; and since
    June 30 these officers have continued the performance of their duties
    without compensation from the Government, taking upon themselves the
    necessary incidental outlays, as well as rendering their own services.
    In only a few unavoidable instances has the proper execution of the
    process of the United States failed by reason of the absence of the
    requisite appropriation. This course of official conduct on the part
    of these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised
    by the Attorney-General, who informed them, however, that they would
    necessarily have to rely for their compensation upon the prospect of
    future legislation by Congress. I therefore especially recommend that
    immediate appropriation be made by Congress for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
    The act making the principal appropriation for the Department of
    Justice at previous sessions has uniformly contained the following
    clause:
</p>
<p class="q">
  And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the
  enforcement of the act approved February 28, 1871, entitled
  "An act to amend an act approved May 31, 1870, entitled 'An
  act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States
  to vote in the several States of this Union, and for other
  purposes,'" or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary
  thereto.
</p>
<p>
    No appropriation was made for this purpose for the current year. As no
    general election for Members of Congress occurred, the omission was
    a matter of little practical importance. Such election will, however,
    take place during the ensuing year, and the appropriation made for
    the pay of marshals and deputies should be sufficient to embrace
    compensation for the services they may be required to perform at such
    elections.
</p>
<p>
    The business of the Supreme Court is at present largely in arrears.
    It can not be expected that more causes can be decided than are
    now disposed of in its annual session, or that by any assiduity the
    distinguished magistrates who compose the court can accomplish more
    than is now done. In the courts of many of the circuits also the
    business has increased to such an extent that the delay of justice
    will call the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is
    believed that all is done in each circuit which can fairly be expected
    from its judicial force. The evils arising from delay are less heavily
    felt by the United States than by private suitors, as its causes
    are advanced by the courts when it is seen that they involve the
    discussion of questions of a public character.
</p>
<p>
    The remedy suggested by the Attorney-General is the appointment of
    additional circuit judges and the creation of an intermediate court of
    errors and appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a part
    of its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the
    performance of circuit duties.
</p>
<p>
    I commend this suggestion to the consideration of Congress. It would
    seem to afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional
    circuit judges are appointed, an expenditure, at the present rate of
    salaries, of not more than $60,000 a year, which would certainly be
    small in comparison with the objects to be attained.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Postmaster-General bears testimony to the general
    revival of business throughout the country. The receipts of the
    Post-Office Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879,
    were $30,041,982.86, being $764,465.91 more than the revenues of the
    preceding year. The amount realized from the sale of postage stamps,
    stamped envelopes, and postal cards was $764,465.91 more than in the
    preceding year, and $2,387,559.23 more than in 1877. The expenditures
    of the Department were $33,449,899.45, of which the sum of $376,461.63
    was paid on liabilities incurred in preceding years.
</p>
<p>
    The expenditures during the year were $801,209.77 less than in the
    preceding year. This reduction is to be attributed mainly to the
    operation of the law passed June 17, 1878, changing the compensation
    of postmasters from a commission on the value of stamps sold to a
    commission on stamps canceled.
</p>
<p>
    The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to
    the revenues of the Department, was $3,031,454.96, being $2,276,197.86
    less than in the preceding year.
</p>
<p>
    The expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are
    estimated at $39,920,900 and the receipts from all sources at
    $32,210,000, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for out of the
    Treasury of $7,710,900.
</p>
<p>
    The relations of the Department with railroad companies have been
    harmonized, notwithstanding the general reduction by Congress of their
    compensation by the appropriation for special facilities, and the
    railway post-office lines have been greatly extended, especially in
    the Southern States. The interests of the Railway Mail Service and
    of the public would be greatly promoted and the expenditures could be
    more readily controlled by the classification of the employees of the
    Railway Mail Service as recommended by the Postmaster-General, the
    appropriation for salaries, with respect to which the maximum limit is
    already fixed by law, to be made in gross.
</p>
<p>
    The Postmaster-General recommends an amendment of the law regulating
    the increase of compensation for increased service and increased speed
    on star routes, so as to enable him to advertise for proposals for
    such increased service and speed. He also suggests the advantages to
    accrue to the commerce of the country from the enactment of a general
    law authorizing contracts with American-built steamers, carrying the
    American flag, for transporting the mail between ports of the United
    States and ports of the West Indies and South America, at a fixed
    maximum price per mile, the amount to be expended being regulated by
    annual appropriations, in like manner with the amount paid for the
    domestic star service.
</p>
<p>
    The arrangement made by the Postmaster-General and the Secretary of
    the Treasury for the collection of duty upon books received in
    the mail from foreign countries has proved so satisfactory in its
    practical operation that the recommendation is now made that Congress
    shall extend the provisions of the act of March 3, 1879, under which
    this arrangement was made, so as to apply to all other dutiable
    articles received in the mails from foreign countries.
</p>
<p>
    The reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissioner
    of Indian Affairs, setting forth the present state of our relations
    with the Indian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance
    their civilization and prosperity, and the progress already achieved
    by them, will be found of more than ordinary interest. The general
    conduct of our Indian population has been so satisfactory that the
    occurrence of two disturbances, which resulted in bloodshed and
    destruction of property, is all the more to be lamented.
</p>
<p>
    The history of the outbreak on the White River Ute Reservation, in
    western Colorado, has become so familiar by elaborate reports in the
    public press that its remarkable incidents need not be stated here
    in detail. It is expected that the settlement of this difficulty will
    lead to such arrangements as will prevent further hostile contact
    between the Indians and the border settlements in western Colorado.
</p>
<p>
    The other disturbance occurred at the Mescalero Agency, in New Mexico,
    where Victoria, at the head of a small band of marauders, after
    committing many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military
    force, made his way across the Mexican border and is now on foreign
    soil.
</p>
<p>
    While these occurrences, in which a comparatively small number of
    Indians were engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority of our
    Indian population have fully justified the expectations of those who
    believe that by humane and peaceful influences the Indian can be led
    to abandon the habits of savage life and to develop a capacity for
    useful and civilized occupations. What they have already accomplished
    in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable
    success which has attended the experiment of employing as freighters
    a class of Indians hitherto counted among the wildest and most
    intractable, and the general and urgent desire expressed by them for
    the education of their children may be taken as sufficient proof that
    they will be found capable of accomplishing much more if they continue
    to be wisely and fairly guided. The "Indian policy" sketched in the
    report of the Secretary of the Interior, the object of which is to
    make liberal provision for the education of Indian youth, to settle
    the Indians upon farm lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to
    their farms, inalienable for a certain number of years, and when their
    wants are thus provided for to dispose by sale of the lands on their
    reservations not occupied and used by them, a fund to be formed out
    of the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians, which will gradually
    relieve the Government of the expenses now provided for by annual
    appropriations, must commend itself as just and beneficial to the
    Indians, and as also calculated to remove those obstructions which
    the existence of large reservations presents to the settlement and
    development of the country. I therefore earnestly recommend the
    enactment of a law enabling the Government to give Indians a title in
    fee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to
    them by allotment. I also repeat the recommendation made in my first
    annual message, that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give
    satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supported their
    families for a number of years, and who are willing to detach
    themselves from their tribal relations, to the benefit of the
    homestead act, and to grant them patents containing the same provision
    of inalienability for a certain period.
</p>
<p>
    The experiment of sending a number of Indian children of both sexes to
    the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, in Virginia, to receive
    an elementary English education and practical instruction in farming
    and other useful industries, has led to results so promising that it
    was thought expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle,
    in Pennsylvania, to the Interior Department for the establishment of
    an Indian school on a larger scale. This school has now 158 pupils,
    selected from various tribes, and is in full operation. Arrangements
    are also made for the education of a number of Indian boys and girls
    belonging to tribes on the Pacific Slope in a similar manner, at
    Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institutions will commend themselves to
    the liberality of Congress and to the philanthropic munificence of the
    American people.
</p>
<p>
    Last spring information was received of the organization of an
    extensive movement in the Western States, the object of which was
    the occupation by unauthorized persons of certain lands in the Indian
    Territory ceded by the Cherokees to the Government for the purpose of
    settlement by other Indian tribes.
</p>
<p>
    On the 26th of April I issued a proclamation<a href="#note-40"><small>40</small></a> warning all persons
    against participation in such an attempt, and by the cooperation of a
    military force the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to
    protect the rights of the Indian inhabitants of that Territory to the
    full extent of the executive power; but it would be unwise to ignore
    the fact that a territory so large and so fertile, with a population
    so sparse and with so great a wealth of unused resources, will be
    found more exposed to the repetition of such attempts as happened
    this year when the surrounding States are more densely settled and the
    westward movement of our population looks still more eagerly for
    fresh lands to occupy. Under such circumstances the difficulty of
    maintaining the Indian Territory in its present state will greatly
    increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to prepare
    for such a contingency. I therefore fully approve of the advice given
    to them by the Secretary of the Interior on a recent occasion, to
    divide among themselves in severalty as large a quantity of their
    lands as they can cultivate; to acquire individual title in fee
    instead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider
    in what manner the balance of their lands may be disposed of by the
    Government for their benefit. By adopting such a policy they would
    more certainly secure for themselves the value of their possessions,
    and at the same time promote their progress in civilization and
    prosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate the present state of
    things in the Territory.
</p>
<p>
    The question whether a change in the control of the Indian service
    should be made was in the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a joint
    committee of both Houses for inquiry and report. In my last annual
    message I expressed the hope that the decision of that question, then
    in prospect, would "arrest further agitation of this subject, such
    agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as
    well as on the Indians themselves." Since then, the committee having
    reported, the question has been decided in the negative by a vote in
    the House of Representatives.
</p>
<p>
    For the reasons here stated, and in view of the fact that further
    uncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other
    much-needed legislation, to weaken the discipline of the service, and
    to unsettle salutary measures now in progress for the government and
    improvement of the Indians, I respectfully recommend that the decision
    arrived at by Congress at its last session be permitted to stand.
</p>
<p>
    The efforts made by the Department of the Interior to arrest the
    depredations on the timber lands of the United States have been
    continued, and have met with considerable success. A large number of
    cases of trespass have been prosecuted in the courts of the United
    States; others have been settled, the trespassers offering to make
    payment to the Government for the value of the timber taken by them.
    The proceeds of these prosecutions and settlements turned into the
    Treasury far exceed in amount the sums appropriated by Congress for
    this purpose. A more important result, however, consists in the fact
    that the destruction of our public forests by depredation, although
    such cases still occur, has been greatly reduced in extent, and it
    is probable that if the present policy is vigorously pursued and
    sufficient provision to that end is made by Congress such trespasses,
    at least those on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, except
    in the Territories, where timber for the daily requirements of the
    population can not, under the present state of the law, be otherwise
    obtained. I therefore earnestly invite the attention of Congress to
    the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that a law
    be enacted enabling the Government to sell timber from the public
    lands without conveying the fee, where such lands are principally
    valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to
    conform to domestic wants and business requirements, while at the
    same time guarding against a sweeping destruction of the forests. The
    enactment of such a law appears to become a more pressing necessity
    every day.
</p>
<p>
    My recommendations in former messages are renewed in favor of
    enlarging the facilities of the Department of Agriculture. Agriculture
    is the leading interest and the permanent industry of our people. It
    is to the abundance of agricultural production, as compared with our
    home consumption, and the largely increased and highly profitable
    market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent years, that we are
    mainly indebted for our present prosperity as a people. We must look
    for its continued maintenance to the same substantial resource.
    There is no branch of industry in which labor, directed by scientific
    knowledge, yields such increased production in comparison with
    unskilled labor, and no branch of the public service to which the
    encouragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropriately
    extended. The omission to render such aid is not a wise economy,
    but, on the contrary, undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums
    annually that might be saved through well-directed efforts by the
    Government to promote this vital interest.
</p>
<p>
    The results already accomplished with the very limited means
    heretofore placed at the command of the Department of Agriculture is
    an earnest of what may be expected with increased appropriations for
    the several purposes indicated in the report of the Commissioner, with
    a view to placing the Department upon a footing which will enable it
    to prosecute more effectively the objects for which it is established.
</p>
<p>
    Appropriations are needed for a more complete laboratory, for the
    establishment of a veterinary division and a division of forestry, and
    for an increase of force.
</p>
<p>
    The requirements for these and other purposes, indicated in the report
    of the Commissioner under the head of the immediate necessities of the
    Department, will not involve any expenditure of money that the country
    can not with propriety now undertake in the interests of agriculture.
</p>
<p>
    It is gratifying to learn from the Bureau of Education the extent to
    which educational privileges throughout the United States have been
    advanced during the year. No more fundamental responsibility rests
    upon Congress than that of devising appropriate measures of financial
    aid to education, supplemental to local action in the States and
    Territories and in the District of Columbia. The wise forethought of
    the founders of our Government has not only furnished the basis for
    the support of the common-school systems of the newer States, but laid
    the foundations for the maintenance of their universities and colleges
    of agriculture and the mechanic arts. Measures in accordance with this
    traditional policy, for the further benefit of all these interests and
    the extension of the same advantages to every portion of the country,
    it is hoped will receive your favorable consideration.
</p>
<p>
    To preserve and perpetuate the national literature should be among the
    foremost cares of the National Legislature. The library gathered at
    the Capitol still remains unprovided with any suitable accommodations
    for its rapidly increasing stores. The magnitude and importance of the
    collection, increased as it is by the deposits made under the law of
    copyright, by domestic and foreign exchanges, and by the scientific
    library of the Smithsonian Institution, call for building
    accommodations which shall be at once adequate and fireproof. The
    location of such a public building, which should provide for the
    pressing necessities of the present and for the vast increase of the
    nation's books in the future, is a matter which addresses itself to
    the discretion of Congress. It is earnestly recommended as a measure
    which should unite all suffrages and which should no longer be
    delayed.
</p>
<p>
    The joint commission created by the act of Congress of August 2, 1876,
    for the purpose of supervising and directing the completion of the
    Washington National Monument, of which commission the President is a
    member, has given careful attention to this subject, and already the
    strengthening of the foundation has so far progressed as to insure the
    entire success of this part of the work. A massive layer of masonry
    has been introduced below the original foundation, widening the base,
    increasing the stability of the structure, and rendering it possible
    to carry the shaft to completion. It is earnestly recommended that
    such further appropriations be made for the continued prosecution
    of the work as may be necessary for the completion of this national
    monument at an early day.
</p>
<p>
    In former messages, impressed with the importance of the subject,
    I have taken occasion to commend to Congress the adoption of a
    generous policy toward the District of Columbia. The report of
    the Commissioners of the District, herewith transmitted, contains
    suggestions and recommendations, to all of which I earnestly invite
    your careful attention. I ask your early and favorable consideration
    of the views which they express as to the urgent need of legislation
    for the reclamation of the marshes of the Potomac and its Eastern
    Branch within the limits of the city, and for the repair of the
    streets of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden blocks and now by
    decay rendered almost impassable and a source of imminent danger
    to the health of its citizens. The means at the disposal of the
    Commissioners are wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of these
    important works, and should be supplemented by timely appropriations
    from the Federal Treasury.
</p>
<p>
    The filling of the flats in front of the city will add to the adjacent
    lands and parks now owned by the United States a large and valuable
    domain, sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its entire cost, and
    will also, as an incidental result, secure the permanent improvement
    of the river for the purposes of navigation.
</p>
<p>
    The Constitution having invested Congress with supreme and exclusive
    jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, its citizens must of
    necessity look to Congress alone for all needful legislation affecting
    their interests; and as the territory of this District is the common
    property of the people of the United States, who equally with its
    resident citizens are interested in the prosperity of their capital,
    I can not doubt that you will be amply sustained by the general voice
    of the country in any measures you may adopt for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
    I also invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the wants of
    the public schools of this District, as exhibited in the report of the
    Commissioners. While the number of pupils is rapidly increasing,
    no adequate provision exists for a corresponding increase of school
    accommodation, and the Commissioners are without the means to meet
    this urgent need. A number of the buildings now used for school
    purposes are rented, and are in important particulars unsuited for the
    purpose. The cause of popular education in the District of Columbia is
    surely entitled to the same consideration at the hands of the
    National Government as in the several States and Territories, to which
    munificent grants of the public lands have been made for the endowment
    of schools and universities.

    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>December 19, 1879</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the Senate and House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    I have the honor to transmit herewith a draft of a bill submitted
    by the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, entitled
    "A bill to provide for the reclamation of the marshes in the harbors
    of the cities of Washington and Georgetown, and for other purposes,"
    together with the accompanying letter of the president of the board
    requesting its transmission to Congress.
</p>
<p>
    The bill embraces a plan for the reclamation of the marshes of the
    Potomac River and its Eastern Branch within the limits of the city
    of Washington, and is carefully framed with a view to economy in the
    prosecution of the work. The attention of Congress is again invited to
    the urgent need of legislation for this important work, which has been
    so long delayed.
</p>
<p>
    The improvement contemplated is essential to the health of those who
    reside, whether permanently or temporarily, at the capital, and to
    the safe and convenient navigation of the waters in its vicinity by
    vessels employed in the service of the Government and for the purposes
    of commerce. It is a measure of more than local benefit. The capital
    of the nation should be relieved from every disadvantage which it is
    practicable to remove, and should possess every attraction with which
    it can be invested by the intelligent and fostering care of those
    who are intrusted with its immediate supervision. The people of the
    country will sustain and approve the efforts of their representatives
    in the discharge of this responsibility.

    I have the honor herewith to transmit the final report of the board

<p>
    The United States testing machine at Watertown Arsenal, constructed
    for the board, is reported as being of great value in the
    determination of data and the solution of problems of interest to the
    people of the whole country, and the special attention of Congress
    is called to the necessity of an appropriation to enable the War
    Department to make use of it. An estimate of $20,000 for the purpose
    was submitted to Congress in the last Book of Estimates (see p. 82),
    and an appropriation of that sum is respectfully recommended.
</p>
<p>
    The act of July 31, 1876 (19 U.S. Statutes at Large, ch. 246, p. 119),
    made an appropriation for completing the experiments in testing
    iron, steel, and other metals, and provided that the board should
    be discontinued from and after the expenditure of the amount
    appropriated. In accordance with this legislation, the board ceased to
    exist on the 30th of June, 1879.

    him by the said judges, upon his being satisfied that such claims were
    just and equitable; and a subsequent act, approved the 26th of June,
    1834 (6 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 569), gave further directions for
    the payment, and also provided for the hearing and determination by
    the judge of the superior court of St. Augustine of such claims as
    had not then been already heard and determined. Under these acts
    of Congress I understand that all claims presented to the judges in
    Florida were passed upon and the result of the proceedings thus had
    reported to the Secretary of the Treasury. It also appears that in
    the computation of damages the judges adopted a rule of 5 per cent per
    annum on the ascertained actual loss from the date of that loss to the
    time of the rendition of their finding, and that the Secretary of the
    Treasury in 1836, when the first reports were presented to him, not
    deeming this portion of the claims covered by the 5 per cent rule
    just and equitable within the meaning of the treaty and the acts of
    Congress, refused to pay it, but did continue to pay the ascertained
    amounts of actual loss. The demand for payment of this rejected
    item has been pressed at various times and in various ways up to the
    present time, but Mr. Woodbury's successors in the Treasury Department
    have not felt at liberty to review that ruling.
</p>
<p>
    Under these circumstances I have thought it proper to lay the subject
    before Congress for its consideration and such action as may be deemed
    necessary. The history of the proceedings already had in regard to the
    matter is of record in the Treasury Department, and will be furnished
    by the Secretary of the Treasury should Congress desire it.

    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>March 8, 1880</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the Senate</i>:
</p>
<p>
    I transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of State and the
    accompanying papers, in response to the resolution adopted by the
    Senate on the 11th day of February last, requesting copies of all
    correspondence between this Government and any foreign government
    since February, 1869, respecting a ship canal across the isthmus
    between North America and South America, together with copies of any
    <i>projet</i> of treaties respecting the same which the Department of State
    may have proposed or submitted since that date to any foreign power or
    its diplomatic representative.
</p>
<p>
    In further compliance with the resolution of the Senate, I deem it
    proper to state briefly my opinion as to the policy of the United
    States with respect to the construction of an interoceanic canal by
    any route across the American Isthmus.
</p>
<p>
    The policy of this country is a canal under American control. The
    United States can not consent to the surrender of this control to any
    European power or to any combination of European powers. If existing
    treaties between the United States and other nations or if the rights
    of sovereignty or property of other nations stand in the way of this
    policy&mdash;a contingency which is not apprehended&mdash;suitable steps should
    be taken by just and liberal negotiations to promote and establish the
    American policy on this subject consistently with the rights of the
    nations to be affected by it.
</p>
<p>
    The capital invested by corporations or citizens of other countries in
    such an enterprise must in a great degree look for protection to
    one or more of the great powers of the world. No European power
    can intervene for such protection without adopting measures on this
    continent which the United States would deem wholly inadmissible. If
    the protection of the United States is relied upon, the United States
    must exercise such control as will enable this country to protect
    its national interests and maintain the rights of those whose private
    capital is embarked in the work.
</p>
<p>
    An interoceanic canal across the American Isthmus will essentially
    change the geographical relations between the Atlantic and Pacific
    coasts of the United States and between the United States and the rest
    of the world. It would be the great ocean thoroughfare between our
    Atlantic and our Pacific shores, and virtually a part of the coast
    line of the United States. Our merely commercial interest in it is
    greater than that of all other countries, while its relations to our
    power and prosperity as a nation, to our means of defense, our unity,
    peace, and safety, are matters of paramount concern to the people
    of the United States. No other great power would under similar
    circumstances fail to assert a rightful control over a work so closely
    and vitally affecting its interest and welfare.
</p>
<p>
    Without urging further the grounds of my opinion, I repeat, in
    conclusion, that it is the right and the duty of the United States
    to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any
    interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connects North and South
    America as will protect our national interests. This, I am quite sure,
    will be found not only compatible with but promotive of the widest and
    most permanent advantage to commerce and civilization.

    MY DEAR SIR: I have been privileged to bring with me from Boston, as a

<p class="r">
    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>May 4, 1880</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    After mature consideration of the bill entitled "An act making
    appropriations to supply certain deficiencies in the appropriations
    for the service of the Government for the fiscal year ending June
    30, 1880, and for other purposes," I return it to the House of
    Representatives, in which it originated, with my objections to its
    passage.
</p>
<p>
    The bill appropriates about $8,000,000, of which over $600,000 is for
    the payment of the fees of United States marshals and of the general
    and special deputy marshals earned during the current fiscal year,
    and their incidental expenses. The appropriations made in the bill are
    needed to carry on the operations of the Government and to fulfill its
    obligations for the payment of money long since due to its officers
    for services and expenses essential to the execution of their
    duties under the laws of the United States. The necessity for these
    appropriations is so urgent and they have been already so long
    delayed that if the bill before me contained no permanent or general
    legislation unconnected with these appropriations it would receive
    my prompt approval. It contains, however, provisions which materially
    change, and by implication repeal, important parts of the laws for the
    regulation of the United States elections. These laws have for several
    years past been the subject of vehement political controversy, and
    have been denounced as unnecessary, oppressive, and unconstitutional.
    On the other hand, it has been maintained with equal zeal and
    earnestness that the election laws are indispensable to fair and
    lawful elections, and are clearly warranted by the Constitution.
    Under these circumstances, to attempt in an appropriation bill the
    modification or repeal of these laws is to annex a condition to the
    passage of needed and proper appropriations, which tends to deprive
    the Executive of that equal and independent exercise of discretion and
    judgment which the Constitution contemplates.
</p>
<p>
    The objection to the bill, therefore, to which I respectfully ask your
    attention is that it gives a marked and deliberate sanction, attended
    by no circumstances of pressing necessity, to the questionable and,
    as I am clearly of opinion, the dangerous practice of tacking upon
    appropriation bills general and permanent legislation. This practice
    opens a wide door to hasty, inconsiderate, and sinister legislation.
    It invites attacks upon the independence and constitutional powers of
    the Executive by providing an easy and effective way of constraining
    Executive discretion. Although of late this practice has been resorted
    to by all political parties when clothed with power, it did not
    prevail until forty years after the adoption of the Constitution, and
    it is confidently believed that it is condemned by the enlightened
    judgment of the country. The States which have adopted new
    constitutions during the last quarter of a century have generally
    provided remedies for the evil. Many of them have enacted that no law
    shall contain more than one subject, which shall be plainly expressed
    in its title. The constitutions of more than half of the States
    contain substantially this provision, or some other of like intent and
    meaning. The public welfare will be promoted in many ways by a return
    to the early practice of the Government and to the true rule of
    legislation, which is that every measure should stand upon its own
    merits.
</p>
<p>
    I am firmly convinced that appropriation bills ought not to contain
    any legislation not relevant to the application or expenditure of the
    money thereby appropriated, and that by a strict adherence to this
    principle an important and much needed reform will be accomplished.
</p>
<p>
    Placing my objection to the bill on this feature of its frame,
    I forbear any comment upon the important general and permanent
    legislation which it contains, as matter for specific and independent
    consideration.

    originated, with my objections to its passage.
</p>
<p>
    The laws now in force on the subject of the bill before me are
    contained in the following sections of the Revised Statutes:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 2021. Whenever an election at which Representatives or
  Delegates in Congress are to be chosen is held in any city
  or town of 20,000 inhabitants or upward, the marshal for the
  district in which the city or town is situated shall, on the
  application in writing of at least two citizens residing in
  such city or town, appoint special deputy marshals, whose
  duty it shall be, when required thereto, to aid and assist
  the supervisors of election in the verification of any list
  of persons who may have registered or voted; to attend in each
  election district or voting precinct at the times and places
  fixed for the registration of voters, and at all times
  or places when and where the registration may by law be
  scrutinized and the names of registered voters be marked
  for challenge; and also to attend, at all times for holding
  elections, the polls in such district or precinct.
</p><p class="q">
  SEC. 2022. The marshal and his general deputies, and such
  special deputies, shall keep the peace and support and protect
  the supervisors of election in the discharge of their duties,
  preserve order at such places of registration and at such
  polls, prevent fraudulent registration and fraudulent voting
  thereat, or fraudulent conduct on the part of any officer of
  election, and immediately, either at the place of registration
  or polling place, or elsewhere, and either before or after
  registering or voting, to arrest and take into custody, with
  or without process, any person who commits, or attempts or
  offers to commit, any of the acts or offenses prohibited
  herein, or who commits any offense against the laws of the
  United States; but no person shall be arrested without process
  for any offense not committed in the presence of the marshal
  or his general or special deputies, or either of them, or of
  the supervisors of election, or either of them; and for
  the purposes of arrest or the preservation of the peace the
  supervisors of election shall, in the absence of the marshal's
  deputies, or if required to assist such deputies, have the
  same duties and powers as deputy marshals; nor shall any
  person, on the day of such election, be arrested without
  process for any offense committed on the day of registration.

<p>
    The Supreme Court of the United States, in the recent case of <i>Ex
    parte</i> Siebold and others, decided at the October term, 1879, on
    the question raised in the case as to the constitutionality of the
    sections of the Revised Statutes above quoted, uses the following
    language:
</p>
<p class="q">
  These portions of the Revised Statutes are taken from the act
  commonly known as the enforcement act, approved May 31, 1870,
  and entitled "An act to enforce the right of citizens of the
  United States to vote in the several States of this Union,
  and for other purposes," and from the supplement to that
  act, approved February 28, 1871. They relate to elections of
  members of the House of Representatives, and were an assertion
  on the part of Congress of a power to pass laws for regulating
  and superintending said elections and for securing the purity
  thereof and the rights of citizens to vote thereat peaceably
  and without molestation.
</p><p class="q">
  It must be conceded to be a most important power, and of a
  fundamental character. In the light of recent history and of
  the violence, fraud, corruption, and irregularity which have
  frequently prevailed at such elections, it may easily be
  conceived that the exertion of the power, if it exists, may be
  necessary to the stability of our form of government.
</p><p class="q">
  The greatest difficulty in coming to a just conclusion arises
  from mistaken notions with regard to the relations which
  subsist between the State and National Governments. * * *
</p><p class="q">
  It seems to be often overlooked that a national constitution
  has been adopted in this country, establishing a real
  government therein, operating upon persons and territory and
  things, and which, moreover, is, or should be, as dear to
  every American citizen as his State government is. Whenever
  the true conception of the nature of this Government is
  once conceded, no real difficulty will arise in the just
  interpretation of its powers; but if we allow ourselves to
  regard it as a hostile organization, opposed to the proper
  sovereignty and dignity of the State governments, we shall
  continue to be vexed with difficulties as to its jurisdiction
  and authority. No greater jealousy is required to be exercised
  toward this Government in reference to the preservation of
  our liberties than is proper to be exercised toward the State
  governments. Its powers are limited in number and clearly
  defined, and its action within the scope of those powers is
  restrained by a sufficiently rigid bill of rights for the
  protection of its citizens from oppression. The true interests
  of the people of this country require that both the National
  and State Governments should be allowed, without jealous
  interference on either side, to exercise all the powers which
  respectively belong to them according to a fair and practical
  construction of the Constitution. State rights and the rights
  of the United States should be equally respected. Both
  are essential to the preservation of our liberties and
  the perpetuity of our institutions. But in endeavoring to
  vindicate the one we should not allow our zeal to nullify or
  impair the other. * * *
</p><p class="q">
  The true doctrine, as we conceive, is this, that while the
  States are really sovereign as to all matters which have not
  been granted to the jurisdiction and control of the United
  States, the Constitution and constitutional laws of the latter
  are, as we have already said, the supreme law of the land,
  and when they conflict with the laws of the States they are
  of paramount authority and obligation. This is the fundamental
  principle on which the authority of the Constitution is based,
  and unless it be conceded in practice as well as theory the
  fabric of our institutions, as it was contemplated by its
  founders, can not stand. The questions involved have respect
  not more to the autonomy and existence of the States than to
  the continued existence of the United States as a government
  to which every American citizen may look for security and
  protection in every part of the land. * * *
</p><p class="q">
  Why do we have marshals at all if they can not physically lay
  their hands on persons and things in the performance of their
  proper duties? What functions can they perform if they can not
  use force? In executing the process of the courts must they
  call on the nearest constable for protection? Must they rely
  on him to use the requisite compulsion and to keep the peace
  while they are soliciting and entreating the parties and
  bystanders to allow the law to take its course? This is the
  necessary consequence of the positions that are assumed. If
  we indulge in such impracticable views as these, and keep
  on refining and re-refining, we shall drive the National
  Government out of the United States and relegate it to the
  District of Columbia, or perhaps to some foreign soil. We
  shall bring it back to a condition of greater helplessness
  than that of the old Confederation.
</p><p class="q">
  The argument is based on a strained and impracticable view
  of the nature and powers of the National Government. It must
  execute its powers or it is no government. It must execute
  them on the land as well as on the sea, on things as well as
  on persons. And to do this it must necessarily have power to
  command obedience, preserve order, and keep the peace; and
  no person or power in this land has the right to resist or
  question its authority so long as it keeps within the bounds
  of its jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
    I have deemed it fitting and proper to quote thus largely from an
    important and elaborate opinion of the Supreme Court because the bill
    before me proceeds upon a construction of the Constitution as to the
    powers of the National Government which is in direct conflict with the
    judgment of the highest judicial tribunal of our country.
</p>
<p>
    Under the sections of the present law above quoted officers of the
    United States are authorized, and it is their duty in the case of
    Congressional elections, to keep the peace at the polls and at the
    places of registration; to arrest immediately any person who is guilty
    of crimes against the United States election laws; to protect all
    officers of elections in the performance of their duties; and
    whenever an arrest is made to bring the person so arrested before a
    commissioner, judge, or court of the United States for examination of
    the offenses alleged against him. "Such special deputy marshals as are
    specially empowered thereto by the marshal in writing," if forcibly
    resisted, may call to their aid the bystanders or <i>posse comitatus</i>.
    It is made a crime punishable with fine or imprisonment to hinder,
    assault, or otherwise interfere with the marshal or "his special
    deputies," or to threaten or to attempt so to do. If any person
    appointed such special deputy marshal has taken the oath of office and
    thereafter neglects or refuses to fully discharge the duties of such
    office, he is punishable not only by removal from office, but by fine
    and imprisonment. The functions of the special deputy marshals
    now provided for by law being executive, they are placed under the
    authority of the well-known chief executive officer of the courts
    of the United States. They are in fact, and not merely in name, the
    deputies of the marshal, and he and his bondsmen are responsible for
    them. A civil force for the execution of the law is thus instituted in
    accordance with long-established and familiar usage, which is simple,
    effective, and under a responsible head. The necessity for the
    possession of these powers by appropriate officers will not be called
    in question by intelligent citizens who appreciate the importance of
    peaceable, orderly, and lawful elections. Similar powers are conferred
    and exercised under State laws with respect to State elections. The
    executive officers of the United States under the existing laws have
    no other or greater power to supervise and control the conduct of the
    Congressional elections than the State executive officers exercise in
    regard to State elections.
</p>
<p>
    The bill before me changes completely the present law by substituting
    for the special deputy marshals of the existing statutes new officers
    hitherto unknown to the law, and who lack the power, responsibility,
    and protection which are essential to enable them to act efficiently
    as executive officers.
</p>
<p>
    The bill under consideration is as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  <i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
  the United States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That
  from and after the passage of this act the pay of all deputy
  marshals for services in reference to any election shall be $5
  for each day of actual service, and no more.
</p><p class="q">
  SEC. 2. That all deputy marshals to serve in reference to any
  election shall be appointed by the circuit court of the United
  States for the district in which such marshals are to perform
  their duties in each year; and the judges of the several
  circuit courts of the United States are hereby authorized to
  open their respective courts at any time for that purpose; and
  in case the circuit courts shall not be open for that purpose
  at least ten days prior to a registration, if there be one,
  or, if no registration be required, then at least ten days
  before such election, the judges of the district courts of
  the United States are hereby respectively authorized to cause
  their courts to be opened for the purpose of appointing such
  deputy marshals, who shall be appointed by the said district
  courts; and the officers so appointed shall be in equal
  numbers from the different political parties, and shall be
  well-known citizens, of good moral character, and actual
  residents of the voting precincts in which their duties are
  to be performed, and shall not be candidates for any office
  at such election; and all laws and parts of laws inconsistent
  with this act are hereby repealed: <i>Provided</i>, That the
  marshals of the United States for whom deputies shall be
  appointed by the court under this act shall not be liable for
  any of the acts of such deputies.
</p>
<p>
    It will be observed that the deputy marshals proposed by the bill
    before me are distinctly different officers from the special deputies
    of the marshal, as such officers are now provided for in the statutes.
    This bill does not connect the new officers with the existing laws
    relating to special deputy marshals so as to invest the proposed
    deputy marshals with the same powers, to impose upon them the same
    duties, and to give them the same protection by means of the criminal
    laws. When new officers are created, distinct in character and
    appointed by different authority, although similar in name to
    officers already provided for, such officers are not held by similar
    responsibilities to the criminal law, do not possess the same powers,
    and are not similarly protected unless it is expressly so provided by
    legislation.
</p>
<p>
    The so-called deputy marshals provided for in this bill will have no
    executive head. The marshal can neither appoint nor remove them. He
    can not control them, and he is not responsible for them. They will
    have no authority to call to their aid, if resisted, the <i>posse
    comitatus</i>. They are protected by no criminal statutes in the
    performance of their duties. An assault upon one of these deputies
    with the intent to prevent a lawful election will be no more than an
    ordinary assault upon any other citizen. They can not keep the peace.
    They can not make arrests when crimes are committed in their presence.
    Whatever powers they have are confined to the precincts in which they
    reside. Outside of the precincts for which they are appointed the
    deputy marshals of this bill can not keep the peace, make arrests,
    hold prisoners, take prisoners before a proper tribunal for hearing,
    nor perform any other duty. No oaths of office are required of them,
    and they give no bond. They have no superior who is responsible for
    them, and they are not punishable for neglect of duty or misconduct in
    office. In all these respects this bill makes a radical change between
    the powers of the United States officers at national elections and the
    powers uniformly possessed and exercised by State officers at State
    elections. This discrimination against the authority of the United
    States is a departure from the usage of the Government established by
    precedents beginning with the earliest statutes on the subject, and
    violates the true principles of the Constitution. The Supreme Court,
    in the decision already referred to, says:
</p>
<p class="q">
  It is argued that the preservation of peace and good order in
  society is not within the powers confided to the Government of
  the United States, but belongs exclusively to the States. Here
  again we are met with the theory that the Government of the
  United States does not rest upon the soil and territory of
  the country. We think that this theory is founded on an entire
  misconception of the nature and powers of that Government.
  We hold it to be an incontrovertible principle that the
  Government of the United States may, by means of physical
  force, exercised through its official agents, execute on every
  foot of American soil the powers and functions that belong to
  it. This necessarily involves the power to command obedience
  to its laws, and hence the power to keep the peace to that
  extent.
</p><p class="q">
  This power to enforce its laws and to execute its functions
  in all places does not derogate from the power of the State to
  execute its laws at the same time and in the same places. The
  one does not exclude the other, except where both can not
  be executed at the same time. In that case the words of the
  Constitution itself show which is to yield. "This Constitution
  and all laws which shall be made in pursuance thereof * * *
  shall be the supreme law of the land."
</p>
<p>
    In conclusion it is proper to say that no objection would be made to
    the appointment of officers to act with reference to the elections by
    the courts of the United States, and that I am in favor of appointing
    officers to supervise and protect the elections without regard to
    party; but the bill before me, while it recognizes the power and duty
    of the United States to provide officers to guard and scrutinize the
    Congressional elections, fails to adapt its provisions to the existing
    laws so as to secure efficient supervision and protection. It is
    therefore returned to the Senate, in which it originated, for that
    further consideration which is contemplated by the Constitution.

<p>
    Whereas it has become known to me that certain evil-disposed persons
    have within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States begun
    and set on foot preparations for an organized and forcible possession
    of and settlement upon the lands of what is known as the Indian
    Territory, west of the State of Arkansas, which Territory is
    designated, recognized, and described by the treaties and laws of the
    United States and by the executive authorities as Indian country, and
    as such is only subject to occupation by Indian tribes, officers of
    the Indian Department, military posts, and such persons as may be
    privileged to reside and trade therein under the intercourse laws of
    the United States; and
</p>
<p>
    Whereas those laws provide for the removal of all persons residing and
    trading therein without express permission of the Indian Department
    and agents, and also of all persons whom such agents may deem to be
    improper persons to reside in the Indian country; and
</p>
<p>
    Whereas, in aid and support of such organized movement, it has been
    represented that no further action will be taken by the Government to
    prevent persons from going into said territory and settling therein,
    but such representations are wholly without authority:
</p>
<p>
    Now, therefore, for the purpose of properly protecting the interests
    of the Indian nations and tribes, as well as of the United States, in
    said Indian Territory, and of duly enforcing the laws governing the
    same, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States, do
    admonish and warn all such persons so intending or preparing to remove
    upon said lands or into said Territory without permission of the
    proper agent of the Indian Department against any attempt to so remove
    or settle upon any of the lands of said Territory; and I do further
    warn and notify any and all such persons who may so offend that they
    will be speedily and immediately removed therefrom by the agent,
    according to the laws made and provided, and that no efforts will be
    spared to prevent the invasion of said Territory, rumors spread
    by evil-disposed persons to the contrary notwithstanding; and if
    necessary the aid and assistance of the military forces of the United
    States will be invoked to carry into proper execution the laws of the
    United States herein referred to.

<h2>
    FOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.
</h2>
<p class="r">
    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>December 6, 1880</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    I congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity of our
    country. By the favor of Divine Providence we have been blessed during
    the past year with health, with abundant harvests, with profitable
    employment for all our people, and with contentment at home, and
    with peace and friendship with other nations. The occurrence of
    the twenty-fourth election of Chief Magistrate has afforded another
    opportunity to the people of the United States to exhibit to the world
    a significant example of the peaceful and safe transmission of the
    power and authority of government from the public servants whose terms
    of office are about to expire to their newly chosen successors. This
    example can not fail to impress profoundly thoughtful people of other
    countries with the advantages which republican institutions afford.
    The immediate, general, and cheerful acquiescence of all good citizens
    in the result of the election gives gratifying assurance to our
    country and to its friends throughout the world that a government
    based on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people
    possesses elements of strength, stability, and permanency not found in
    any other form of government.
</p>
<p>
    Continued opposition to the full and free enjoyment of the rights of
    citizenship conferred upon the colored people by the recent amendments
    to the Constitution still prevails in several of the late slaveholding
    States. It has, perhaps, not been manifested in the recent election to
    any large extent in acts of violence or intimidation. It has, however,
    by fraudulent practices in connection with the ballots, with the
    regulations as to the places and manner of voting, and with counting,
    returning, and canvassing the votes cast, been successful in defeating
    the exercise of the right preservative of all rights&mdash;the right
    of suffrage&mdash;which the Constitution expressly confers upon our
    enfranchised citizens.
</p>
<p>
    It is the desire of the good people of the whole country that
    sectionalism as a factor in our politics should disappear. They prefer
    that no section of the country should be united in solid opposition
    to any other section. The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty
    obedience to the equal-rights amendments to the Constitution is all
    that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional
    lines in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments
    is flagrantly violated or disregarded, it is safe to assume that
    the people who placed them in the Constitution, as embodying the
    legitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believe them to
    be wise and necessary, will continue to act together and to insist
    that they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still is as to the
    enjoyment of the right by every American citizen who has the requisite
    qualifications to freely cast his vote and to have it honestly
    counted. With this question rightly settled, the country will be
    relieved of the contentions of the past; bygones will indeed be
    bygones, and political and party issues, with respect to economy
    and efficiency of administration, internal improvements, the tariff,
    domestic taxation, education, finance, and other important subjects,
    will then receive their full share of attention; but resistance to
    and nullification of the results of the war will unite together in
    resolute purpose for their support all who maintain the authority of
    the Government and the perpetuity of the Union, and who adequately
    appreciate the value of the victory achieved. This determination
    proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the
    people of our country or to any of their interests. The inviolability
    of the amendments rests upon the fundamental principle of our
    Government. They are the solemn expression of the will of the people
    of the United States.
</p>
<p>
    The sentiment that the constitutional rights of all our citizens must
    be maintained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the
    Government of the country. Happily, the history of the late election
    shows that in many parts of the country where opposition to the
    fifteenth amendment has heretofore prevailed it is diminishing, and is
    likely to cease altogether if firm and well-considered action is taken
    by Congress. I trust the House of Representatives and the Senate,
    which have the right to judge of the elections, returns, and
    qualifications of their own members, will see to it that every case
    of violation of the letter or spirit of the fifteenth amendment is
    thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall
    accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty of the Executive,
    with sufficient appropriations for the purpose, to prosecute
    unsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the
    rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution.
</p>
<p>
    It is not, however, to be forgotten that the best and surest guaranty
    of the primary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity
    for self-protection which can belong only to a people whose right to
    universal suffrage is supported by universal education. The means
    at the command of the local and State authorities are in many cases
    wholly inadequate to furnish free instruction to all who need it.
    This is especially true where before emancipation the education of the
    people was neglected or prevented, in the interest of slavery. Firmly
    convinced that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest
    attention of the people of the whole country, with a view to wise
    and comprehensive action by the Government of the United States, I
    respectfully recommend that Congress, by suitable legislation and
    with proper safeguards, supplement the local educational funds in
    the several States where the grave duties and responsibilities of
    citizenship have been devolved on uneducated people by devoting to
    the purpose grants of the public lands and, if necessary, by
    appropriations from the Treasury of the United States. Whatever
    Government can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to be
    done. Wherever general education is found, peace, virtue, and social
    order prevail and civil and religious liberty are secure.
</p>
<p>
    In my former annual messages I have asked the attention of Congress to
    the urgent necessity of a reformation of the civil-service system
    of the Government. My views concerning the dangers of patronage,
    or appointments for personal or partisan considerations, have been
    strengthened by my observation and experience in the Executive office,
    and I believe these dangers threaten the stability of the Government.
    Abuses so serious in their nature can not be permanently tolerated.
    They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of
    administrative service, as the growth of the country in population
    increases the number of officers and placemen employed.
</p>
<p>
    The reasons are imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for the
    regulation of appointments, promotions, and removals, establishing
    a uniform method having exclusively in view in every instance the
    attainment of the best qualifications for the position in question.
    Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of all
    citizens and the most economical and efficient administration of the
    public business.
</p>
<p>
    Competitive examinations in aid of impartial appointments and
    promotions have been conducted for some years past in several of
    the Executive Departments, and by my direction this system has been
    adopted in the custom-houses and post-offices of the larger cities of
    the country. In the city of New York over 2,000 positions in the civil
    service have been subject in their appointments and tenure of place to
    the operation of published rules for this purpose during the past
    two years. The results of these practical trials have been very
    satisfactory, and have confirmed my opinion in favor of this system of
    selection. All are subjected to the same tests, and the result is free
    from prejudice by personal favor or partisan influence. It secures for
    the position applied for the best qualifications attainable among the
    competing applicants. It is an effectual protection from the pressure
    of importunity, which under any other course pursued largely exacts
    the time and attention of appointing officers, to their great
    detriment in the discharge of other official duties, preventing the
    abuse of the service for the mere furtherance of private or party
    purposes, and leaving the employee of the Government, freed from the
    obligations imposed by patronage, to depend solely upon merit for
    retention and advancement, and with this constant incentive to
    exertion and improvement.
</p>
<p>
    These invaluable results have been attained in a high degree in the
    offices where the rules for appointment by competitive examination
    have been applied.
</p>
<p>
    A method which has so approved itself by experimental tests at
    points where such tests may be fairly considered conclusive should be
    extended to all subordinate positions under the Government. I believe
    that a strong and growing public sentiment demands immediate measures
    for securing and enforcing the highest possible efficiency in the
    civil service and its protection from recognized abuses, and that
    the experience referred to has demonstrated the feasibility of such
    measures.
</p>
<p>
    The examinations in the custom-houses and post-offices have been held
    under many embarrassments and without provision for compensation for
    the extra labor performed by the officers who have conducted them, and
    whose commendable interest in the improvement of the public service
    has induced this devotion of time and labor without pecuniary reward.
    A continuance of these labors gratuitously ought not to be expected,
    and without an appropriation by Congress for compensation it is not
    practicable to extend the system of examinations generally throughout
    the civil service. It is also highly important that all such
    examinations should be conducted upon a uniform system and under
    general supervision. Section 1753 of the Revised Statutes authorizes
    the President to prescribe the regulations for admission to the civil
    service of the United States, and for this purpose to employ suitable
    persons to conduct the requisite inquiries with reference to "the
    fitness of each candidate, in respect to age, health, character,
    knowledge, and ability for the branch of service into which he seeks
    to enter;" but the law is practically inoperative for want of the
    requisite appropriation.
</p>
<p>
    I therefore recommend an appropriation of $25,000 per annum to meet
    the expenses of a commission, to be appointed by the President in
    accordance with the terms of this section, whose duty it shall be
    to devise a just, uniform, and efficient system of competitive
    examinations and to supervise the application of the same throughout
    the entire civil service of the Government. I am persuaded that the
    facilities which such a commission will afford for testing the fitness
    of those who apply for office will not only be as welcome a relief
    to members of Congress as it will be to the President and heads of
    Departments, but that it will also greatly tend to remove the causes
    of embarrassment which now inevitably and constantly attend the
    conflicting claims of patronage between the legislative and executive
    departments. The most effectual check upon the pernicious competition
    of influence and official favoritism in the bestowal of office will
    be the substitution of an open competition of merit between the
    applicants, in which everyone can make his own record with the
    assurance that his success will depend upon this alone.
</p>
<p>
    I also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as
    free as any other citizen to express his political opinions and to use
    his means for their advancement, shall also enable him to feel as safe
    as any private citizen in refusing all demands upon his salary for
    political purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty
    and justice to all who are engaged in the public service, and likewise
    contain stringent provisions against the use of official authority
    to coerce the political action of private citizens or of official
    subordinates, is greatly to be desired.
</p>
<p>
    The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil
    service, and especially to a reform in the method of appointment and
    removal, has been found to be the practice, under what is known as
    the spoils system, by which the appointing power has been so largely
    encroached upon by members of Congress. The first step in the reform
    of the civil service must be a complete divorce between Congress and
    the Executive in the matter of appointments. The corrupting
    doctrine that "to the victors belong the spoils" is inseparable
    from Congressional patronage as the established rule and practice of
    parties in power. It comes to be understood by applicants for office
    and by the people generally that Representatives and Senators are
    entitled to disburse the patronage of their respective districts and
    States. It is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting
    from this invasion of the Executive functions. The true principles of
    Government on the subject of appointments to office, as stated in the
    national conventions of the leading parties of the country, have again
    and again been approved by the American people, and have not been
    called in question in any quarter. These authentic expressions of
    public opinion upon this all-important subject are the statement
    of principles that belong to the constitutional structure of the
    Government.
</p>
<p class="q">
  Under the Constitution the President and heads of Departments
  are to make nominations for office. The Senate is to advise
  and consent to appointments, and the House of Representatives
  is to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The best
  interest of the public service demands that these distinctions
  be respected; that Senators and Representatives, who may
  be judges and accusers, should not dictate appointments to
  office.
</p>
<p>
    To this end the cooperation of the legislative department of the
    Government is required alike by the necessities of the case and by
    public opinion. Members of Congress will not be relieved from the
    demands made upon them with reference to appointments to office until
    by legislative enactment the pernicious practice is condemned and
    forbidden.
</p>
<p>
    It is therefore recommended that an act be passed defining the
    relations of members of Congress with respect to appointment to office
    by the President; and I also recommend that the provisions of section
    1767 and of the sections following of the Revised Statutes, comprising
    the tenure-of-office act of March 2, 1867, be repealed.
</p>
<p>
    Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service
    in our country is one of the highest and most imperative duties
    of statesmanship, and that it can be permanently done only by the
    cooperation of the legislative and executive departments of the
    Government, I again commend the whole subject to your considerate
    attention.
</p>
<p>
    It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United
    States to suppress polygamy where it now exists in our Territories and
    to prevent its extension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been made
    by the United States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws against
    it. Experience has shown that the legislation upon this subject, to be
    effective, requires extensive modification and amendment. The longer
    action is delayed the more difficult it will be to accomplish what
    is desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Mormon
    sectarian organization which upholds polygamy has the whole power of
    making and executing the local legislation of the Territory. By its
    control of the grand and petit juries it possesses large influence
    over the administration of justice. Exercising, as the heads of this
    sect do, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to
    make effective their hostility to the law of Congress on the subject
    of polygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will
    not be abolished if the enforcement of the law depends on those who
    practice and uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking
    away the political power of the sect which encourages and sustains it.
</p>
<p>
    The power of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect the
    Territories is ample. It is not a case for halfway measures. The
    political power of the Mormon sect is increasing. It controls now
    one of our wealthiest and most populous Territories. It is extending
    steadily into other Territories. Wherever it goes it establishes
    polygamy and sectarian political power. The sanctity of marriage and
    the family relation are the corner stone of our American society and
    civilization. Religious liberty and the separation of church and state
    are among the elementary ideas of free institutions. To reestablish
    the interests and principles which polygamy and Mormonism have
    imperiled, and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immigrants
    of all creeds that part of our domain which has been in a great degree
    closed to general immigration by intolerant and immoral institutions,
    it is recommended that the government of the Territory of Utah be
    reorganized.
</p>
<p>
    I recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a
    governor and judges, or commissioners, appointed by the President and
    confirmed by the Senate&mdash;a government analogous to the provisional
    government established for the territory northwest of the Ohio by
    the ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the
    existing form of local government, I recommend that the right to vote,
    hold office, and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah be confined to
    those who neither practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures
    are adopted, it is believed that within a few years the evils which
    now afflict Utah will be eradicated, and that this Territory will in
    good time become one of the most prosperous and attractive of the new
    States of the Union.
</p>
<p>
    Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of
    undisturbed peace, and have presented no occasion for concern as to
    their continued maintenance.
</p>
<p>
    My anticipation of an early reply from the British Government to the
    demand of indemnity to our fishermen for the injuries suffered by that
    industry at Fortune Bay in January, 1878, which I expressed in my last
    annual message, was disappointed. This answer was received only in the
    latter part of April in the present year, and when received exhibited
    a failure of accord between the two Governments as to the measure of
    the inshore fishing privilege secured to our fishermen by the treaty
    of Washington of so serious a character that I made it the subject of
    a communication to Congress, in which I recommended the adoption of
    the measures which seemed to me proper to be taken by this Government
    in maintenance of the rights accorded to our fishermen under the
    treaty and toward securing an indemnity for the injury these interests
    had suffered. A bill to carry out these recommendations was under
    consideration by the House of Representatives at the time of the
    adjournment of Congress in June last.
</p>
<p>
    Within a few weeks I have received a communication from Her Majesty's
    Government renewing the consideration of the subject, both of the
    indemnity for the injuries at Fortune Bay and of the interpretation
    of the treaty in which the previous correspondence had shown the two
    Governments to be at variance. Upon both these topics the disposition
    toward a friendly agreement is manifested by a recognition of our
    right to an indemnity for the transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the
    measure of such indemnity to further conference, and by an assent to
    the view of this Government, presented in the previous correspondence,
    that the regulation of conflicting interests of the shore fishery
    of the provincial seacoasts and the vessel fishery of our fishermen
    should be made the subject of conference and concurrent arrangement
    between the two Governments.
</p>
<p>
    I sincerely hope that the basis may be found for a speedy adjustment
    of the very serious divergence of views in the interpretation of
    the fishery clauses of the treaty of Washington, which, as the
    correspondence between the two Governments stood at the close of the
    last session of Congress, seemed to be irreconcilable.
</p>
<p>
    In the important exhibition of arts and industries which was held last
    year at Sydney, New South Wales, as well as in that now in progress
    at Melbourne, the United States have been efficiently and honorably
    represented. The exhibitors from this country at the former place
    received a large number of awards in some of the most considerable
    departments, and the participation of the United States was recognized
    by a special mark of distinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne the
    share taken by our country is no less notable, and an equal degree of
    success is confidently expected.
</p>
<p>
    The state of peace and tranquillity now enjoyed by all the nations
    of the continent of Europe has its favorable influence upon our
    diplomatic and commercial relations with them. We have concluded and
    ratified a convention with the French Republic for the settlement of
    claims of the citizens of either country against the other. Under this
    convention a commission, presided over by a distinguished publicist,
    appointed in pursuance of the request of both nations by His Majesty
    the Emperor of Brazil, has been organized and has begun its sessions
    in this city. A congress to consider means for the protection of
    industrial property has recently been in session in Paris, to which
    I have appointed the ministers of the United States in France and in
    Belgium as delegates. The International Commission upon Weights and
    Measures also continues its work in Paris. I invite your attention to
    the necessity of an appropriation to be made in time to enable
    this Government to comply with its obligations under the metrical
    convention.
</p>
<p>
    Our friendly relations with the German Empire continue without
    interruption. At the recent International Exhibition of Fish
    and Fisheries at Berlin the participation of the United States,
    notwithstanding the haste with which the commission was forced to make
    its preparations, was extremely successful and meritorious, winning
    for private exhibitors numerous awards of a high class and for the
    country at large the principal prize of honor offered by His Majesty
    the Emperor. The results of this great success can not but be
    advantageous to this important and growing industry. There have been
    some questions raised between the two Governments as to the proper
    effect and interpretation of our treaties of naturalization, but
    recent dispatches from our minister at Berlin show that favorable
    progress is making toward an understanding in accordance with the
    views of this Government, which makes and admits no distinction
    whatever between the rights of a native and a naturalized citizen of
    the United States. In practice the complaints of molestation suffered
    by naturalized citizens abroad have never been fewer than at present.
</p>
<p>
    There is nothing of importance to note in our unbroken friendly
    relations with the Governments of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Portugal,
    Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, and Greece.
</p>
<p>
    During the last summer several vessels belonging to the merchant
    marine of this country, sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies,
    were fired at, boarded, and searched by an armed cruiser of the
    Spanish Government. The circumstances as reported involve not only a
    private injury to the persons concerned, but also seemed too little
    observant of the friendly relations existing for a century between
    this country and Spain. The wrong was brought to the attention of
    the Spanish Government in a serious protest and remonstrance, and the
    matter is undergoing investigation by the royal authorities with a
    view to such explanation or reparation as may be called for by the
    facts.
</p>
<p>
    The commission sitting in this city for the adjudication of claims of
    our citizens against the Government of Spain is, I hope, approaching
    the termination of its labors.
</p>
<p>
    The claims against the United States under the Florida treaty with
    Spain were submitted to Congress for its action at the late session,
    and I again invite your attention to this long-standing question, with
    a view to a final disposition of the matter.
</p>
<p>
    At the invitation of the Spanish Government, a conference has recently
    been held at the city of Madrid to consider the subject of protection
    by foreign powers of native Moors in the Empire of Morocco. The
    minister of the United States in Spain was directed to take part
    in the deliberations of this conference, the result of which is
    a convention signed on behalf of all the powers represented. The
    instrument will be laid before the Senate for its consideration. The
    Government of the United States has also lost no opportunity to urge
    upon that of the Emperor of Morocco the necessity, in accordance with
    the humane and enlightened spirit of the age, of putting an end to the
    persecutions, which have been so prevalent in that country, of
    persons of a faith other than the Moslem, and especially of the Hebrew
    residents of Morocco.
</p>
<p>
    The consular treaty concluded with Belgium has not yet been officially
    promulgated, owing to the alteration of a word in the text by the
    Senate of the United States, which occasioned a delay, during which
    the time allowed for ratification expired. The Senate will be asked to
    extend the period for ratification.
</p>
<p>
    The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extradition with Denmark failed
    on account of the objection of the Danish Government to the usual
    clause providing that each nation should pay the expense of the arrest
    of the persons whose extradition it asks.
</p>
<p>
    The provision made by Congress at its last session for the expense
    of the commission which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations
    with the Imperial Government of China on subjects of great interest
    to the relations of the two countries enabled the commissioners
    to proceed at once upon their mission. The Imperial Government was
    prepared to give prompt and respectful attention to the matters
    brought under negotiation, and the conferences proceeded with such
    rapidity and success that on the 17th of November last two treaties
    were signed at Peking, one relating to the introduction of Chinese
    into this country and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescot, one of
    the commissioners, is now on his way home bringing the treaties, and
    it is expected that they will be received in season to be laid before
    the Senate early in January.
</p>
<p>
    Our minister in Japan has negotiated a convention for the reciprocal
    relief of shipwrecked seamen. I take occasion to urge once more
    upon Congress the propriety of making provision for the erection of
    suitable fireproof buildings at the Japanese capital for the use of
    the American legation and the court-house and jail connected with
    it. The Japanese Government, with great generosity and courtesy, has
    offered for this purpose an eligible piece of land.
</p>
<p>
    In my last annual message I invited the attention of Congress to the
    subject of the indemnity funds received some years ago from China and
    Japan. I renew the recommendation then made that whatever portions of
    these funds are due to American citizens should be promptly paid
    and the residue returned to the nations, respectively, to which they
    justly and equitably belong.
</p>
<p>
    The extradition treaty with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which has
    been for some time in course of negotiation, has during the past year
    been concluded and duly ratified.
</p>
<p>
    Relations of friendship and amity have been established between the
    Government of the United States and that of Roumania. We have sent
    a diplomatic representative to Bucharest, and have received at this
    capital the special envoy who has been charged by His Royal Highness
    Prince Charles to announce the independent sovereignty of Roumania. We
    hope for a speedy development of commercial relations between the two
    countries.
</p>
<p>
    In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence of
    quiet on the border between this country and Mexico would soon become
    so assured as to justify the modification of the orders then in force
    to our military commanders in regard to crossing the frontier, without
    encouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of the two
    countries. Events moved in accordance with these expectations, and the
    orders were accordingly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our
    own citizens and the Mexican Government. Subsequently the peace of the
    border was again disturbed by a savage foray under the command of
    the Chief Victoria, but by the combined and harmonious action of the
    military forces of both countries his band has been broken up and
    substantially destroyed.
</p>
<p>
    There is reason to believe that the obstacles which have so long
    prevented rapid and convenient communication between the United States
    and Mexico by railways are on the point of disappearing, and that
    several important enterprises of this character will soon be set on
    foot, which can not fail to contribute largely to the prosperity of
    both countries.
</p>
<p>
    New envoys from Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, and
    Nicaragua have recently arrived at this capital, whose distinction and
    enlightenment afford the best guaranty of the continuance of friendly
    relations between ourselves and these sister Republics.
</p>
<p>
    The relations between this Government and that of the United States of
    Colombia have engaged public attention during the past year, mainly by
    reason of the project of an interoceanic canal across the Isthmus of
    Panama, to be built by private capital under a concession from
    the Colombian Government for that purpose. The treaty obligations
    subsisting between the United States and Colombia, by which we
    guarantee the neutrality of the transit and the sovereignty and
    property of Colombia in the Isthmus, make it necessary that the
    conditions under which so stupendous a change in the region embraced
    in this guaranty should be effected&mdash;transforming, as it would, this
    Isthmus from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans into a
    gateway and thoroughfare between them for the navies and the merchant
    ships of the world&mdash;should receive the approval of this Government, as
    being compatible with the discharge of these obligations on our part
    and consistent with our interests as the principal commercial power
    of the Western Hemisphere. The views which I expressed in a special
    message to Congress in March last in relation to this project I
    deem it my duty again to press upon your attention. Subsequent
    consideration has but confirmed the opinion "that it is the right and
    duty of the United States to assert and maintain such supervision and
    authority over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connects
    North and South America as will protect our national interest."

    The war between the Republic of Chile on the one hand and the allied
    Republics of Peru and Bolivia on the other still continues. This
    Government has not felt called upon to interfere in a contest that is
    within the belligerent rights of the parties as independent states.
    We have, however, always held ourselves in readiness to aid in
    accommodating their difference, and have at different times reminded
    both belligerents of our willingness to render such service.
</p>
<p>
    Our good offices in this direction were recently accepted by all the
    belligerents, and it was hoped they would prove efficacious; but I
    regret to announce that the measures which the ministers of the United
    States at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take with the view to
    bring about a peace were not successful. In the course of the war some
    questions have arisen affecting neutral rights. In all of these the
    ministers of the United States have, under their instructions, acted
    with promptness and energy in protection of American interests.
</p>
<p>
    The relations of the United States with the Empire of Brazil continue
    to be most cordial, and their commercial intercourse steadily
    increases, to their mutual advantage.
</p>
<p>
    The internal disorders with which the Argentine Republic has for some
    time past been afflicted, and which have more or less influenced its
    external trade, are understood to have been brought to a close. This
    happy result may be expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign
    commerce of that Republic, as well as to the development of its vast
    interior resources.

    In Samoa the Government of King Malietoa, under the support and
    recognition of the consular representatives of the United States,
    Great Britain, and Germany, seems to have given peace and tranquillity
    to the islands. While it does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole
    the scheme of tripartite local government which has been proposed, the
    common interests of the three great treaty powers require harmony in
    their relations to the native frame of government, and this may be
    best secured by a simple diplomatic agreement between them. It would
    be well if the consular jurisdiction of our representative at Apia
    were increased in extent and importance so as to guard American
    interests in the surrounding and outlying islands of Oceanica.

    The obelisk generously presented by the Khedive of Egypt to the city
    of New York has safely arrived in this country, and will soon be
    erected in that metropolis. A commission for the liquidation of the
    Egyptian debt has lately concluded its work, and this Government, at
    the earnest solicitation of the Khedive, has acceded to the provisions
    adopted by it, which will be laid before Congress for its information.
    A commission for the revision of the judicial code of the
    reform tribunal of Egypt is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Farman,
    consul-general, and J.M. Batchelder, esq., have been appointed as
    commissioners to participate in this work. The organization of the
    reform tribunals will probably be continued for another period of five
    years.
</p>
<p>
    In pursuance of the act passed at the last session of Congress,
    invitations have been extended to foreign maritime states to join in
    a sanitary conference in Washington, beginning the 1st of January. The
    acceptance of this invitation by many prominent powers gives promise
    of success in this important measure, designed to establish a system
    of international notification by which the spread of infectious or
    epidemic diseases may be more effectively checked or prevented. The
    attention of Congress is invited to the necessary appropriations for
    carrying into effect the provisions of the act referred to.
</p>
<p>
    The efforts of the Department of State to enlarge the trade and
    commerce of the United States, through the active agency of consular
    officers and through the dissemination of information obtained from
    them, have been unrelaxed. The interest in these efforts, as developed
    in our commercial communities, and the value of the information
    secured by this means to the trade and manufactures of the country
    were recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was
    made for the more frequent publication of consular and other reports
    by the Department of State. The first issue of this publication has
    now been prepared, and subsequent issues may regularly be expected.
    The importance and interest attached to the reports of consular
    officers are witnessed by the general demand for them by all classes
    of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is
    believed that the system of such publications is deserving of the
    approval of Congress, and that the necessary appropriations for its
    continuance and enlargement will commend itself to your consideration.
</p>
<p>
    The prosperous energies of our domestic industries and their immense
    production of the subjects of foreign commerce invite, and even
    require, an active development of the wishes and interests of
    our people in that direction. Especially important is it that our
    commercial relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South
    America, with the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico, should be
    direct, and not through the circuit of European systems, and should
    be carried on in our own bottoms. The full appreciation of the
    opportunities which our front on the Pacific Ocean gives to commerce
    with Japan, China, and the East Indies, with Australia and the island
    groups which lie along these routes of navigation, should inspire
    equal efforts to appropriate to our own shipping and to administer by
    our own capital a due proportion of this trade. Whatever modifications
    of our regulations of trade and navigation may be necessary or useful
    to meet and direct these impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges
    and of our carrying trade I am sure the wisdom of Congress will be
    ready to supply. One initial measure, however, seems to me so clearly
    useful and efficient that I venture to press it upon your earnest
    attention. It seems to be very evident that the provision of regular
    steam postal communication by aid from government has been the
    forerunner of the commercial predominance of Great Britain on all
    these coasts and seas, a greater share in whose trade is now the
    desire and the intent of our people. It is also manifest that the
    efforts of other European nations to contend with Great Britain for a
    share of this commerce have been successful in proportion with their
    adoption of regular steam postal communication with the markets whose
    trade they sought. Mexico and the States of South America are anxious
    to receive such postal communication with this country and to aid in
    their development. Similar cooperation may be looked for in due time
    from the Eastern nations and from Australia. It is difficult to see
    how the lead in this movement can be expected from private interests.
    In respect of foreign commerce quite as much as in internal trade
    postal communication seems necessarily a matter of common and public
    administration, and thus pertaining to Government. I respectfully
    recommend to your prompt attention such just and efficient measures as
    may conduce to the development of our foreign commercial exchanges and
    the building up of our carrying trade.
</p>
<p>
    In this connection I desire also to suggest the very great service
    which might be expected in enlarging and facilitating our commerce on
    the Pacific Ocean were a transmarine cable laid from San Francisco to
    the Sandwich Islands, and thence to Japan at the north and Australia
    at the south. The great influence of such means of communication on
    these routes of navigation in developing and securing the due share of
    our Pacific Coast in the commerce of the world needs no illustration
    or enforcement. It may be that such an enterprise, useful, and in the
    end profitable, as it would prove to private investment, may need to
    be accelerated by prudent legislation by Congress in its aid, and
    I submit the matter to your careful consideration.
</p>
<p>
    An additional and not unimportant, although secondary, reason for
    fostering and enlarging the Navy may be found in the unquestionable
    service to the expansion of our commerce which would be rendered by
    the frequent circulation of naval ships in the seas and ports of all
    quarters of the globe. Ships of the proper construction and equipment
    to be of the greatest efficiency in case of maritime war might be made
    constant and active agents in time of peace in the advancement and
    protection of our foreign trade and in the nurture and discipline of
    young seamen, who would naturally in some numbers mix with and improve
    the crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants at home and abroad
    recognize the value to foreign commerce of an active movement of our
    naval vessels, and the intelligence and patriotic zeal of our naval
    officers in promoting every interest of their countrymen is a just
    subject of national pride.
</p>
<p>
    The condition of the financial affairs of the Government, as shown by
    the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisfactory. It
    is believed that the present financial situation of the United States,
    whether considered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing
    wealth, or the extent and variety of our resources, is more favorable
    than that of any other country of our time, and has never been
    surpassed by that of any country at any period of its history. All our
    industries are thriving; the rate of interest is low; new railroads
    are being constructed; a vast immigration is increasing our
    population, capital, and labor; new enterprises in great number are
    in progress, and our commercial relations with other countries are
    improving.

    The amount due the sinking fund for this year was $37,931,643.55.
    There was applied thereto the sum of $73,904,617.41, being
    $35,972,973.86 in excess of the actual requirements for the year.
</p>
<p>
    The aggregate of the revenues from all sources during the fiscal
    year ended June 30, 1880, was $333,526,610.98, an increase over the
    preceding year of $59,699,426.52. The receipts thus far of the current
    year, together with the estimated receipts for the remainder of the
    year, amount to $350,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet the
    estimated expenditures of the year and leave a surplus of $90,000,000.
</p>
<p>
    It is fortunate that this large surplus revenue occurs at a period
    when it may be directly applied to the payment of the public debt soon
    to be redeemable. No public duty has been more constantly cherished
    in the United States than the policy of paying the nation's debt as
    rapidly as possible.
</p>
<p>
    The debt of the United States, less cash in the Treasury and exclusive
    of accruing interest, attained its maximum of $2,756,431,571.43
    in August, 1865, and has since that time been reduced to
    $1,886,019,504.65. Of the principal of the debt, $108,758,100 has been
    paid since March 1, 1877, effecting an annual saving of interest of
    $6,107,593. The burden of interest has also been diminished by the
    sale of bonds bearing a low rate of interest and the application of
    the proceeds to the redemption of bonds bearing a higher rate. The
    annual saving thus secured since March 1, 1877, is $14,290,453.50.
    Within a short period over six hundred millions of 5 and 6 per
    cent bonds will become redeemable. This presents a very favorable
    opportunity not only to further reduce the principal of the debt, but
    also to reduce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid.
    I call the attention of Congress to the views expressed on this
    subject by the Secretary of the Treasury in his annual report, and
    recommend prompt legislation to enable the Treasury Department to
    complete the refunding of the debt which is about to mature.
</p>
<p>
    The continuance of specie payments has not been interrupted or
    endangered since the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly
    to the revival of business and to our remarkable prosperity. The fears
    that preceded and accompanied resumption have proved groundless. No
    considerable amount of United States notes have been presented for
    redemption, while very large sums of gold bullion, both domestic and
    imported, are taken to the mints and exchanged for coin or notes. The
    increase of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1,
    1879, is estimated at $227,399,428.
</p>
<p>
    There are still in existence, uncanceled, $346,681,016 of United
    States legal-tender notes. These notes were authorized as a war
    measure, made necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in which
    the United States was then engaged. The preservation of the nation's
    existence required, in the judgment of Congress, an issue of
    legal-tender paper money. That it served well the purpose for which
    it was created is not questioned, but the employment of the notes as
    paper money indefinitely, after the accomplishment of the object for
    which they were provided, was not contemplated by the framers of the
    law under which they were issued. These notes long since became, like
    any other pecuniary obligation of the Government, a debt to be paid,
    and when paid to be canceled as mere evidence of an indebtedness
    no longer existing. I therefore repeat what was said in the annual
    message of last year, that the retirement from circulation of United
    States notes with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts is
    a step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and stable currency
    which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government and
    the interest and security of the people.
</p>
<p>
    At the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the
    coinage of silver dollars, fixing their value, and giving them
    legal-tender character it was believed by many of the supporters of
    the measure that the silver dollar which it authorized would speedily
    become, under the operations of the law, of equivalent value to the
    gold dollar. There were other supporters of the bill, who, while
    they doubted as to the probability of this result, nevertheless were
    willing to give the proposed experiment a fair trial, with a view to
    stop the coinage if experience should prove that the silver dollar
    authorized by the bill continued to be of less commercial value than
    the standard gold dollar.
</p>
<p>
    The coinage of silver dollars under the act referred to began in
    March, 1878, and has been continued as required by the act. The
    average rate per month to the present time has been $2,276,492. The
    total amount coined prior to the 1st of November last was $72,847,750.
    Of this amount $47,084,450 remain in the Treasury, and only
    $25,763,291 are in the hands of the people. A constant effort has been
    made to keep this currency in circulation, and considerable expense
    has been necessarily incurred for this purpose; but its return to the
    Treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation of
    the friends of the measure at the time of its adoption, the value
    of the silver dollar containing 412-1/2 grains of silver has
    not increased. During the year prior to the passage of the bill
    authorizing its coinage the market value of the silver which it
    contained was from 90 to 92 cents as compared with the standard gold
    dollar. During the last year the average market value of the silver
    dollar has been 88-1/2 cents.
</p>
<p>
    It is obvious that the legislation of the last Congress in regard to
    silver, so far as it was based on an anticipated rise in the value
    of silver as a result of that legislation, has failed to produce the
    effect then predicted. The longer the law remains in force, requiring,
    as it does, the coinage of a nominal dollar which in reality is not
    a dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this country will be
    forced to accept a single metal as the sole legal standard of value in
    circulation, and this a standard of less value than it purports to be
    worth in the recognized money of the world.
</p>
<p>
    The Constitution of the United States, sound financial principles,
    and our best interests all require that the country should have as its
    legal-tender money both gold and silver coin of an intrinsic value,
    as bullion, equivalent to that which upon its face it purports to
    possess. The Constitution in express terms recognizes both gold and
    silver as the only true legal-tender money. To banish either of these
    metals from our currency is to narrow and limit the circulating medium
    of exchange to the disparagement of important interests. The United
    States produces more silver than any other country, and is directly
    interested in maintaining it as one of the two precious metals which
    furnish the coinage of the world. It will, in my judgment, contribute
    to this result if Congress will repeal so much of existing legislation
    as requires the coinage of silver dollars containing only 412-1/2
    grains of silver, and in its stead will authorize the Secretary of the
    Treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent value, as bullion, with
    gold dollars. This will defraud no man, and will be in accordance with
    familiar precedents. Congress on several occasions has altered the
    ratio of value between gold and silver, in order to establish it more
    nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of value between the two
    metals.
</p>
<p>
    In financial legislation every measure in the direction of greater
    fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligations has been found
    by experience to diminish the rates of interest which debtors are
    required to pay and to increase the facility with which money can
    be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial
    history shows how surely money becomes abundant whenever confidence
    in the exact performance of moneyed obligations is established.
</p>
<p>
    The Secretary of War reports that the expenditures of the
    War Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, were
    $39,924,773.03. The appropriations for this Department for the current
    fiscal year amount to $41,993,630.40.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to the Army, the Secretary invites attention to the fact
    that its strength is limited by statute (U.S. Revised Statutes,
    sec. 1115) to not more than 30,000 enlisted men, but that provisos
    contained in appropriation bills have limited expenditures to the
    enlistment of but 25,000. It is believed the full legal strength is
    the least possible force at which the present organization can be
    maintained, having in view efficiency, discipline, and economy. While
    the enlistment of this force would add somewhat to the appropriation
    for pay of the Army, the saving made in other respects would be more
    than an equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficiency of
    the Army would be largely increased.
</p>
<p>
    The rapid extension of the railroad system west of the Mississippi
    River and the great tide of settlers which has flowed in upon new
    territory impose on the military an entire change of policy. The
    maintenance of small posts along wagon and stage routes of travel
    is no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at points selected, of a
    more substantial character than those heretofore constructed, will be
    required. Under existing laws permanent buildings can not be erected
    without the sanction of Congress, and when sales of military sites
    and buildings have been authorized the moneys received have reverted
    to the Treasury and could only become available through a new
    appropriation. It is recommended that provision be made by a general
    statute for the sale of such abandoned military posts and buildings as
    are found to be unnecessary and for the application of the proceeds
    to the construction of other posts. While many of the present posts
    are of but slight value for military purposes, owing to the changed
    condition of the country, their occupation is continued at great
    expense and inconvenience, because they afford the only available
    shelter for troops.
</p>
<p>
    The absence of a large number of officers of the line, in active duty,
    from their regiments is a serious detriment to the maintenance of
    the service. The constant demand for small detachments, each of which
    should be commanded by a commissioned officer, and the various details
    of officers for necessary service away from their commands occasion
    a scarcity in the number required for company duties. With a view to
    lessening this drain to some extent, it is recommended that the law
    authorizing the detail of officers from the active list as professors
    of tactics and military science at certain colleges and universities
    be so amended as to provide that all such details be made from the
    retired list of the Army.
</p>
<p>
    Attention is asked to the necessity of providing by legislation for
    organizing, arming, and disciplining the <i>active</i> militia of the
    country, and liberal appropriations are recommended in this behalf.
    The reports of the Adjutant-General of the Army and the Chief of
    Ordnance touching this subject fully set forth its importance.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the officer in charge of education in the Army shows
    that there are 78 schools now in operation in the Army, with an
    aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and children. The Secretary
    recommends the enlistment of 150 schoolmasters, with the rank and
    pay of commissary-sergeants. An appropriation is needed to supply the
    judge-advocates of the Army with suitable libraries, and the Secretary
    recommends that the Corps of Judge-Advocates be placed upon the same
    footing as to promotion with the other staff corps of the Army. Under
    existing laws the Bureau of Military Justice consists of one officer
    (the Judge-Advocate-General), and the Corps of Judge-Advocates of
    eight officers of equal rank (majors), with a provision that the
    limit of the corps shall remain at four when reduced by casualty
    or resignation to that number. The consolidation of the Bureau of
    Military Justice and the Corps of Judge-Advocates upon the same
    basis with the other staff corps of the Army would remove an unjust
    discrimination against deserving officers and subserve the best
    interests of the service.
</p>
<p>
    Especial attention is asked to the report of the Chief of Engineers
    upon the condition of our national defenses. From a personal
    inspection of many of the fortifications referred to, the Secretary
    is able to emphasize the recommendations made and to state that their
    incomplete and defenseless condition is discreditable to the country.
    While other nations have been increasing their means for carrying on
    offensive warfare and attacking maritime cities, we have been dormant
    in preparation for defense. Nothing of importance has been done toward
    strengthening and finishing our casemated works since our late civil
    war, during which the great guns of modern warfare and the heavy armor
    of modern fortifications and ships came into use among the nations;
    and our earthworks, left by a sudden failure of appropriations some
    years since in all stages of incompletion, are now being rapidly
    destroyed by the elements.
</p>
<p>
    The two great rivers of the North American continent, the Mississippi
    and the Columbia, have their navigable waters wholly within the limits
    of the United States, and are of vast importance to our internal and
    foreign commerce. The permanency of the important work on the South
    Pass of the Mississippi River seems now to be assured. There has been
    no failure whatever in the maintenance of the maximum channel during
    the six months ended August 9 last. This experiment has opened a
    broad, deep highway to the ocean, and is an improvement upon the
    permanent success of which congratulations may be exchanged among
    people abroad and at home, and especially among the communities of
    the Mississippi Valley, whose commercial exchanges float in an
    unobstructed channel safely to and from the sea.
</p>
<p>
    A comprehensive improvement of the Mississippi and its tributaries is
    a matter of transcendent importance. These great waterways comprise
    a system of inland transportation spread like network over a large
    portion of the United States, and navigable to the extent of many
    thousands of miles. Producers and consumers alike have a common
    interest in such unequaled facilities for cheap transportation.
    Geographically, commercially, and politically, they are the strongest
    tie between the various sections of the country. These channels of
    communication and interchange are the property of the nation.
    Its jurisdiction is paramount over their waters, and the plainest
    principles of public interest require their intelligent and careful
    supervision, with a view to their protection, improvement, and the
    enhancement of their usefulness.
</p>
<p>
    The channel of the Columbia River for a distance of about 100 miles
    from its mouth is obstructed by a succession of bars, which occasion
    serious delays in navigation and heavy expense for lighterage and
    towage. A depth of at least 20 feet at low tide should be secured
    and maintained to meet the requirements of the extensive and growing
    inland and ocean commerce it subserves. The most urgent need, however,
    for this great waterway is a permanent improvement of the channel at
    the mouth of the river.
</p>
<p>
    From Columbia River to San Francisco, a distance of over 600 miles,
    there is no harbor on our Pacific coast which can be approached
    during stormy weather. An appropriation of $150,000 was made by the
    Forty-fifth Congress for the commencement of a breakwater and harbor
    of refuge, to be located at some point between the Straits of Fuca and
    San Francisco at which the necessities of commerce, local and general,
    will be best accommodated. The amount appropriated is thought to be
    quite inadequate for the purpose intended. The cost of the work, when
    finished, will be very great, owing to the want of natural advantages
    for a site at any point on the coast between the designated limits,
    and it has not been thought to be advisable to undertake the work
    without a larger appropriation. I commend the matter to the attention
    of Congress.
</p>
<p>
    The completion of the new building for the War Department is urgently
    needed, and the estimates for continuing its construction are
    especially recommended.
</p>
<p>
    The collections of books, specimens, and records constituting the Army
    Medical Museum and Library are of national importance. The library
    now contains about 51,500 volumes and 57,000 pamphlets relating to
    medicine, surgery, and allied topics. The contents of the Army Medical
    Museum consist of 22,000 specimens, and are unique in the completeness
    with which both military surgery and the diseases of armies are
    illustrated. Their destruction would be an irreparable loss, not only
    to the United States, but to the world. There are filed in the Record
    and Pension Division over 16,000 bound volumes of hospital records,
    together with a great quantity of papers, embracing the original
    records of the hospitals of our armies during the civil war. Aside
    from their historical value, these records are daily searched for
    evidence needed in the settlement of large numbers of pension and
    other claims, for the protection of the Government against attempted
    frauds, as well as for the benefit of honest claimants. These valuable
    collections are now in a building which is peculiarly exposed to the
    danger of destruction by fire. It is therefore earnestly recommended
    that an appropriation be made for a new fireproof building, adequate
    for the present needs and reasonable future expansion of these
    valuable collections. Such a building should be absolutely fireproof;
    no expenditure for mere architectural display is required. It is
    believed that a suitable structure can be erected at a cost not to
    exceed $250,000.
</p>
<p>
    I commend to the attention of Congress the great services of the
    Commander in Chief of our armies during the war for the Union, whose
    wise, firm, and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that momentous
    conflict to a close. The legislation of the United States contains
    many precedents for the recognition of distinguished military merit,
    authorizing rank and emoluments to be conferred for eminent services
    to the country. An act of Congress authorizing the appointment of
    a Captain-General of the Army, with suitable provisions relating to
    compensation, retirement, and other details, would, in my judgment,
    be altogether fitting and proper, and would be warmly approved by the
    country.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the successful and
    satisfactory management of that Department during the last fiscal
    year. The total expenditures for the year were $12,916,639.45, leaving
    unexpended at the close of the year $2,141,682.23 of the amount of
    available appropriations. The appropriations for the present fiscal
    year, ending June 30, 1881, are $15,095,061.45, and the total
    estimates for the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1882, are
    $15,953,751.61. The amount drawn by warrant from July 1, 1880, to
    November 1, 1880, is $5,041,570.45.
</p>
<p>
    The recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy that provision be made
    for the establishment of some form of civil government for the people
    of Alaska is approved. At present there is no protection of persons or
    property in that Territory except such as is afforded by the officers
    of the United States ship <i>Jamestown</i>. This vessel was dispatched to
    Sitka because of the fear that without the immediate presence of the
    national authority there was impending danger of anarchy. The steps
    taken to restore order have been accepted in good faith by both white
    and Indian inhabitants, and the necessity for this method of restraint
    does not, in my opinion, now exist. If, however, the <i>Jamestown</i>
    should be withdrawn, leaving the people, as at present, without the
    ordinary judicial and administrative authority of organized local
    government, serious consequences might ensue.
</p>
<p>
    The laws provide only for the collection of revenue, the protection of
    public property, and the transmission of the mails. The problem is to
    supply a local rule for a population so scattered and so peculiar in
    its origin and condition. The natives are reported to be teachable and
    self-supporting, and if properly instructed doubtless would advance
    rapidly in civilization, and a new factor of prosperity would be added
    to the national life. I therefore recommend the requisite legislation
    upon this subject.
</p>
<p>
    The Secretary of the Navy has taken steps toward the establishment
    of naval coaling stations at the Isthmus of Panama, to meet the
    requirements of our commercial relations with Central and South
    America, which are rapidly growing in importance. Locations eminently
    suitable, both as regards our naval purposes and the uses of commerce,
    have been selected, one on the east side of the Isthmus, at Chiriqui
    Lagoon, in the Caribbean Sea, and the other on the Pacific coast, at
    the Bay of Golfito. The only safe harbors, sufficiently commodious, on
    the Isthmus are at these points, and the distance between them is less
    than 100 miles. The report of the Secretary of the Navy concludes with
    valuable suggestions with respect to the building up of our merchant
    marine service, which deserve the favorable consideration of Congress.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Postmaster-General exhibits the continual growth and
    the high state of efficiency of the postal service. The operations
    of no Department of the Government, perhaps, represent with greater
    exactness the increase in the population and the business of the
    country. In 1860 the postal receipts were $8,518,067.40; in 1880 the
    receipts were $33,315,479.34. All the inhabitants of the country are
    directly and personally interested in having proper mail facilities,
    and naturally watch the Post-Office very closely. This careful
    oversight on the part of the people has proved a constant stimulus
    to improvement. During the past year there was an increase of 2,134
    post-offices, and the mail routes were extended 27,177 miles, making
    an additional annual transportation of 10,804,191 miles. The
    revenues of the postal service for the ensuing year are estimated
    at $38,845,174.10, and the expenditures at $42,475,932, leaving a
    deficiency to be appropriated out of the Treasury of $3,630,757.90.
</p>
<p>
    The Universal Postal Union has received the accession of almost all
    the countries and colonies of the world maintaining organized postal
    services, and it is confidently expected that all the other countries
    and colonies now outside the union will soon unite therewith, thus
    realizing the grand idea and aim of the founders of the union of
    forming, for purposes of international mail communication, a single
    postal territory, embracing the world, with complete uniformity
    of postal charges and conditions of international exchange for all
    descriptions of correspondence. To enable the United States to do its
    full share of this great work, additional legislation is asked by the
    Postmaster-General, to whose recommendations especial attention is
    called.
</p>
<p>
    The suggestion of the Postmaster-General that it would be wise to
    encourage, by appropriate legislation, the establishment of American
    lines of steamers by our own citizens to carry the mails between our
    own ports and those of Mexico, Central America, South America, and of
    transpacific countries is commended to the serious consideration of
    Congress.
</p>
<p>
    The attention of Congress is also invited to the suggestions of the
    Postmaster-General in regard to postal savings.
</p>
<p>
    The necessity for additional provision to aid in the transaction of
    the business of the Federal courts becomes each year more apparent.
    The dockets of the Supreme Court and of the circuit courts in the
    greater number of the circuits are encumbered with the constant
    accession of cases. In the former court, and in many instances in
    the circuit courts, years intervene before it is practicable to bring
    cases to hearing.
</p>
<p>
    The Attorney-General recommends the establishment of an intermediate
    court of errors and appeals. It is recommended that the number of
    judges of the circuit court in each circuit, with the exception of the
    second circuit, should be increased by the addition of another
    judge; in the second circuit, that two should be added; and that an
    intermediate appellate court should be formed in each circuit, to
    consist of the circuit judges and the circuit justice, and that in the
    event of the absence of either of these judges the place of the absent
    judge should be supplied by the judge of one of the district courts
    in the circuit. Such an appellate court could be safely invested with
    large jurisdiction, and its decisions would satisfy suitors in many
    cases where appeals would still be allowed to the Supreme Court.
    The expense incurred for this intermediate court will require a
    very moderate increase of the appropriations for the expenses of the
    Department of Justice. This recommendation is commended to the careful
    consideration of Congress.
</p>
<p>
    It is evident that a delay of justice, in many instances oppressive
    and disastrous to suitors, now necessarily occurs in the Federal
    courts, which will in this way be remedied.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Secretary of the Interior presents an elaborate
    account of the operations of that Department during the past year. It
    gives me great pleasure to say that our Indian affairs appear to be in
    a more hopeful condition now than ever before. The Indians have made
    gratifying progress in agriculture, herding, and mechanical pursuits.
    Many who were a few years ago in hostile conflict with the Government
    are quietly settling down on farms where they hope to make their
    permanent homes, building houses and engaging in the occupations of
    civilized life. The introduction of the freighting business among them
    has been remarkably fruitful of good results, in giving many of
    them congenial and remunerative employment and in stimulating their
    ambition to earn their own support. Their honesty, fidelity, and
    efficiency as carriers are highly praised. The organization of a
    police force of Indians has been equally successful in maintaining law
    and order upon the reservations and in exercising a wholesome moral
    influence among the Indians themselves. I concur with the Secretary
    of the Interior in the recommendation that the pay of this force be
    increased, as an inducement to the best class of young men to enter
    it.
</p>
<p>
    Much care and attention has been devoted to the enlargement of
    educational facilities for the Indians. The means available for this
    important object have been very inadequate. A few additional boarding
    schools at Indian agencies have been established and the erection
    of buildings has been begun for several more; but an increase of the
    appropriations for this interesting undertaking is greatly needed to
    accommodate the large number of Indian children of school age. The
    number offered by their parents from all parts of the country for
    education in the Government schools is much larger than can be
    accommodated with the means at present available for that purpose. The
    number of Indian pupils at the normal school at Hampton, Va., under
    the direction of General Armstrong, has been considerably increased,
    and their progress is highly encouraging. The Indian school
    established by the Interior Department in 1879 at Carlisle, Pa., under
    the direction of Captain Pratt, has been equally successful. It has
    now nearly 200 pupils of both sexes, representing a great variety
    of the tribes east of the Rocky Mountains. The pupils in both these
    institutions receive not only an elementary English education, but
    are also instructed in housework, agriculture, and useful mechanical
    pursuits. A similar school was established this year at Forest Grove,
    Oreg., for the education of Indian youth on the Pacific Coast. In
    addition to this, thirty-six Indian boys and girls were selected
    from the Eastern Cherokees and placed in boarding schools in North
    Carolina, where they are to receive an elementary English education
    and training in industrial pursuits. The interest shown by Indian
    parents, even among the so-called wild tribes, in the education of
    their children is very gratifying, and gives promise that the results
    accomplished by the efforts now making will be of lasting benefit.
</p>
<p>
    The expenses of Indian education have so far been drawn from the
    permanent civilization fund at the disposal of the Department of the
    Interior, but the fund is now so much reduced that the continuance
    of this beneficial work will in the future depend on specific
    appropriations by Congress for the purpose; and I venture to express
    the hope that Congress will not permit institutions so fruitful of
    good results to perish for want of means for their support. On the
    contrary, an increase of the number of such schools appears to me
    highly advisable.
</p>
<p>
    The past year has been unusually free from disturbances among the
    Indian tribes. An agreement has been made with the Utes by which they
    surrender their large reservation in Colorado in consideration of
    an annuity to be paid to them, and agree to settle in severalty
    on certain lands designated for that purpose, as farmers, holding
    individual title to their land in fee-simple, inalienable for a
    certain period. In this way a costly Indian war has been avoided,
    which at one time seemed imminent, and for the first time in the
    history of the country an Indian nation has given up its tribal
    existence to be settled in severalty and to live as individuals under
    the common protection of the laws of the country.
</p>
<p>
    The conduct of the Indians throughout the country during the past
    year, with but few noteworthy exceptions, has been orderly and
    peaceful. The guerrilla warfare carried on for two years by Victoria
    and his band of Southern Apaches has virtually come to an end by the
    death of that chief and most of his followers on Mexican soil. The
    disturbances caused on our northern frontier by Sitting Bull and his
    men, who had taken refuge in the British dominions, are also likely
    to cease. A large majority of his followers have surrendered to our
    military forces, and the remainder are apparently in progress of
    disintegration.
</p>
<p>
    I concur with the Secretary of the Interior in expressing the earnest
    hope that Congress will at this session take favorable action on
    the bill providing for the allotment of lands on the different
    reservations in severalty to the Indians, with patents conferring
    fee-simple title inalienable for a certain period, and the eventual
    disposition of the residue of the reservations for general settlement,
    with the consent and for the benefit of the Indians, placing the
    latter under the equal protection of the laws of the country. This
    measure, together with a vigorous prosecution of our educational
    efforts, will work the most important and effective advance toward the
    solution of the Indian problem, in preparing for the gradual merging
    of our Indian population in the great body of American citizenship.
</p>
<p>
    A large increase is reported in the disposal of public lands for
    settlement during the past year, which marks the prosperous growth of
    our agricultural industry and a vigorous movement of population toward
    our unoccupied lands. As this movement proceeds, the codification
    of our land laws, as well as proper legislation to regulate the
    disposition of public lands, become of more pressing necessity, and I
    therefore invite the consideration of Congress to the report and the
    accompanying draft of a bill made by the Public Lands Commission,
    which were communicated by me to Congress at the last session. Early
    action upon this important subject is highly desirable.
</p>
<p>
    The attention of Congress is again asked to the wasteful depredations
    committed on our public timber lands and the rapid and indiscriminate
    destruction of our forests. The urgent necessity for legislation to
    this end is now generally recognized. In view of the lawless character
    of the depredations committed and the disastrous consequences which
    will inevitably follow their continuance, legislation has again and
    again been recommended to arrest the evil and to preserve for the
    people of our Western States and Territories the timber needed for
    domestic and other essential uses.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Director of the Geological Survey is a document
    of unusual interest. The consolidation of the various geological and
    geographical surveys and exploring enterprises, each of which has
    heretofore operated upon an independent plan, without concert, can
    not fail to be of great benefit to all those industries of the country
    which depend upon the development of our mineral resources. The labors
    of the scientific men, of recognized merit, who compose the corps
    of the Geological Survey, during the first season of their field
    operations and inquiries, appear to have been very comprehensive,
    and will soon be communicated to Congress in a number of volumes.
    The Director of the Survey recommends that the investigations carried
    on by his bureau, which so far have been confined to the so-called
    public-land States and Territories, be extended over the entire country,
    and that the necessary appropriation be made for this purpose. This
    would be particularly beneficial to the iron, coal, and other mining
    interests of the Mississippi Valley and of the Eastern and Southern
    States. The subject is commended to the careful consideration of
    Congress.
</p>
<p>
    The Secretary of the Interior asks attention to the want of room in
    the public buildings of the capital, now existing and in progress of
    construction, for the accommodation of the clerical force employed and
    of the public records. Necessity has compelled the renting of private
    buildings in different parts of the city for the location of public
    offices, for which a large amount of rent is annually paid, while the
    separation of offices belonging to the same Department impedes the
    transaction of current business. The Secretary suggests that the
    blocks surrounding Lafayette Square on the east, north, and west be
    purchased as the sites for new edifices for the accommodation of the
    Government offices, leaving the square itself intact, and that if such
    buildings were constructed upon a harmonious plan of architecture
    they would add much to the beauty of the national capital, and would,
    together with the Treasury and the new State, Navy, and War Department
    building, form one of the most imposing groups of public edifices in
    the world.
</p>
<p>
    The Commissioner of Agriculture expresses the confident belief that
    his efforts in behalf of the production of our own sugar and tea have
    been encouragingly rewarded. The importance of the results attained
    have attracted marked attention at home and have received the special
    consideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our
    own tea and the manufacture of our own sugar would make a difference
    of many millions of dollars annually in the wealth of the nation.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the Commissioner asks attention particularly to the
    continued prevalence of an infectious and contagious cattle
    disease known and dreaded in Europe and Asia as cattle plague, or
    pleuro-pneumonia. A mild type of this disease in certain sections
    of our country is the occasion of great loss to our farmers and of
    serious disturbance to our trade with Great Britain, which furnishes
    a market for most of our live stock and dressed meats. The value of
    neat cattle exported from the United States for the eight months ended
    August 31, 1880, was more than $12,000,000, and nearly double the
    value for the same period in 1879&mdash;an unexampled increase of export
    trade. Your early attention is solicited to this important matter.
</p>
<p>
    The Commissioner of Education reports a continued increase of public
    interest in educational affairs, and that the public schools generally
    throughout the country are well sustained. Industrial training
    is attracting deserved attention, and colleges for instruction,
    theoretical and practical, in agriculture and mechanic arts, including
    the Government schools recently established for the instruction
    of Indian youth, are gaining steadily in public estimation. The
    Commissioner asks special attention to the depredations committed on
    the lands reserved for the future support of public instruction, and
    to the very great need of help from the nation for schools in the
    Territories and in the Southern States. The recommendation heretofore
    made is repeated and urged, that an educational fund be set apart from
    the net proceeds of the sales of the public lands annually, the
    income of which and the remainder of the net annual proceeds to
    be distributed on some satisfactory plan to the States and the
    Territories and the District of Columbia.
</p>
<p>
    The success of the public schools of the District of Columbia, and
    the progress made, under the intelligent direction of the board
    of education and the superintendent, in supplying the educational
    requirements of the District with thoroughly trained and efficient
    teachers, is very gratifying. The acts of Congress, from time to time,
    donating public lands to the several States and Territories in aid
    of educational interests have proved to be wise measures of public
    policy, resulting in great and lasting benefit. It would seem to be a
    matter of simple justice to extend the benefits of this legislation,
    the wisdom of which has been so fully vindicated by experience, to the
    District of Columbia.
</p>
<p>
    I again commend the general interests of the District of Columbia
    to the favorable consideration of Congress. The affairs of the
    District, as shown by the report of the Commissioners, are in a very
    satisfactory condition.
</p>
<p>
    In my annual messages heretofore and in my special message of December
    19, 1879, I have urged upon the attention of Congress the necessity of
    reclaiming the marshes of the Potomac adjacent to the capital, and I
    am constrained by its importance to advert again to the subject. These
    flats embrace an area of several hundred acres. They are an impediment
    to the drainage of the city and seriously impair its health. It is
    believed that with this substantial improvement of its river front the
    capital would be in all respects one of the most attractive cities
    in the world. Aside from its permanent population, this city is
    necessarily the place of residence of persons from every section of
    the country engaged in the public service. Many others reside here
    temporarily for the transaction of business with the Government.
</p>
<p>
    It should not be forgotten that the land acquired will probably be
    worth the cost of reclaiming it and that the navigation of the river
    will be greatly improved. I therefore again invite the attention of
    Congress to the importance of prompt provision for this much needed
    and too long delayed improvement.
</p>
<p>
    The water supply of the city is inadequate. In addition to the
    ordinary use throughout the city, the consumption by Government is
    necessarily very great in the navy-yard, arsenal, and the various
    Departments, and a large quantity is required for the proper
    preservation of the numerous parks and the cleansing of sewers. I
    recommend that this subject receive the early attention of Congress,
    and that in making provision for an increased supply such means be
    adopted as will have in view the future growth of the city. Temporary
    expedients for such a purpose can not but be wasteful of money,
    and therefore unwise. A more ample reservoir, with corresponding
    facilities for keeping it filled, should, in my judgment, be
    constructed. I commend again to the attention of Congress the subject
    of the removal from their present location of the depots of the
    several railroads entering the city; and I renew the recommendations
    of my former messages in behalf of the erection of a building for the
    Congressional Library, the completion of the Washington Monument, and
    of liberal appropriations in support of the benevolent, reformatory,
    and penal institutions of the District.

    <i>To the Senate of the United States:</i>
</p>
<p>
    I transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to
    ratification, a convention for the establishment, on fixed and uniform

</p>
<p>
    In compliance with the request of a large number of intelligent
    and benevolent citizens, and believing that it was warranted by the
    extraordinary circumstances of the case, on the 18th day of December,
    1880, I appointed a commission consisting of George Crook and Nelson
    A. Miles, brigadier-generals in the Army; William Stickney, of
    the District of Columbia, and Walter Allen, of Massachusetts,
    and requested them to confer with the Ponca Indians in the Indian
    Territory, and, if in their judgment it was advisable, also with that
    part of the tribe which remained in Dakota, and "to ascertain the
    facts in regard to their removal and present condition so far as was
    necessary to determine the question as to what justice and humanity
    required should be done by the Government of the United States, and to
    report their conclusions and recommendations in the premises."
</p>
<p>
    The commission, in pursuance of these instructions, having visited the
    Ponca Indians at their homes in the Indian Territory and in Dakota
    and made a careful investigation of the subject referred to them, have
    reported their conclusions and recommendations, and I now submit their
    report, together with the testimony taken, for the consideration of
    Congress. A minority report by Mr. Allen is also herewith submitted.
</p>
<p>
    On the 27th of December, 1880, a delegation of Ponca chiefs from the
    Indian Territory presented to the Executive a declaration of their
    wishes, in which they stated that it was their desire "to remain on
    the lands now occupied by the Poncas in the Indian Territory" and "to
    relinquish all their right and interest in the lands formerly owned
    and occupied by the Ponca tribe in the State of Nebraska and the
    Territory of Dakota;" and the declaration sets forth the compensation
    which they will accept for the lands to be surrendered and for the
    injuries done to the tribe by their removal to the Indian Territory.
    This declaration, agreeably to the request of the chiefs making it, is
    herewith transmitted to Congress.
</p>
<p>
    The public attention has frequently been called to the injustice and
    wrong which the Ponca tribe of Indians has suffered at the hands of
    the Government of the United States. This subject was first brought
    before Congress and the country by the Secretary of the Interior in
    his annual report for the year 1877, in which he said:
</p>
<p class="q">
  The case of the Poncas seems entitled to especial
  consideration at the hands of Congress. They have always been
  friendly to the whites. It is said, and, as far as I have been
  able to learn, truthfully, that no Ponca ever killed a
  white man. The orders of the Government have always met with
  obedient compliance at their hands. Their removal from their
  old homes on the Missouri River was to them a great hardship.
  They had been born and raised there. They had houses there in
  which they lived according to their ideas of comfort. Many
  of them had engaged in agriculture and possessed cattle and
  agricultural implements. They were very reluctant to leave all
  this, but when Congress had resolved upon their removal they
  finally overcame that reluctance and obeyed. Considering
  their constant good conduct, their obedient spirit, and the
  sacrifices they have made, they are certainly entitled to
  more than ordinary care at the hands of the Government, and I
  urgently recommend that liberal provision be made to aid them
  in their new settlement.
</p>
<p>
    In the same volume the report of E.A. Howard, the agent of the Poncas,
    is published, which contains the following:
</p>
<hr>
<p class="q">
  I am of the opinion that the removal of the Poncas from the
  northern climate of Dakota to the southern climate of the
  Indian Territory at the season of the year it was done will
  prove a mistake, and that a great mortality will surely follow
  among the people when they shall have been here for a time and
  become poisoned with the malaria of the climate. Already the
  effects of the climate may be seen upon them in the <i>ennui</i>
  that seems to have settled upon each and in the large number
  now sick.
</p><p class="q">
  It is a matter of astonishment to me that the Government
  should have ordered the removal of the Ponca Indians from
  Dakota to the Indian Territory without having first made
  some provision for their settlement and comfort. Before their
  removal was carried into effect an appropriation should have
  been made by Congress sufficient to have located them in their
  new home, by building a comfortable house for the occupancy
  of every family of the tribe. As the case now is, no
  appropriation has been made by Congress, except for a sum but
  little more than sufficient to remove them; no houses have
  been built for their use, and the result is that these people
  have been placed on an uncultivated reservation to live in
  their tents as best they may, and await further legislative
  action.
</p>
<hr>
<p class="q">
  These Indians claim that the Government had no right to move
  them from their reservation without first obtaining from them
  by purchase or treaty the title which they had acquired
  from the Government, and for which they rendered a valuable
  consideration. They claim that the date of the settlement of
  their tribe upon the land composing their old reservation is
  prehistoric; that they were all born there, and that their
  ancestors from generations back beyond their knowledge were
  born and lived upon its soil, and that they finally acquired
  a complete and perfect title from the Government by a treaty
  made with the "Great Father" at Washington, which they claim
  made it as legitimately theirs as is the home of the white man
  acquired by gift or purchase.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    The subject was again referred to in similar terms in the annual
    report of the Interior Department for 1878, in the reports of the
    Commissioner of Indian Affairs and of the agent for the Poncas, and in
    1879 the Secretary of the Interior said:
</p>
<p class="q">
  That the Poncas were grievously wronged by their removal from
  their location on the Missouri River to the Indian Territory,
  their old reservation having, by a mistake in making the Sioux
  treaty, been transferred to the Sioux, has been at length and
  repeatedly set forth in my reports, as well as those of the
  Commissioner of Indian Affairs. All that could be subsequently
  done by this Department in the absence of new legislation to
  repair that wrong and to indemnify them for their losses
  has been done with more than ordinary solicitude. They were
  permitted to select a new location for themselves in the
  Indian Territory, the Quapaw Reserve, to which they had first
  been taken, being objectionable to them. They chose a tract of
  country on the Arkansas River and the Salt Fork northwest of
  the Pawnee Reserve. I visited their new reservation personally
  to satisfy myself of their condition. The lands they now
  occupy are among the very best in the Indian Territory in
  point of fertility, well watered and well timbered, and
  admirably adapted for agriculture as well as stock raising. In
  this respect their new reservation is unquestionably superior
  to that which they left behind them on the Missouri River.
  Seventy houses have been built by and for them, of far better
  quality than the miserable huts they formerly occupied in
  Dakota, and the construction of a larger number is now in
  progress, so that, as the agent reports, every Ponca family
  will be comfortably housed before January. A very liberal
  allowance of agricultural implements and stock cattle has been
  given them, and if they apply themselves to agricultural work
  there is no doubt that their condition will soon be far more
  prosperous than it has ever been before. During the first
  year after their removal to the Indian Territory they lost
  a comparatively large number of their people by death, in
  consequence of the change of climate, which is greatly to
  be deplored; but their sanitary condition is now very much
  improved. The death rate among them during the present year
  has been very low, and the number of cases of sickness
  is constantly decreasing. It is thought that they are now
  sufficiently acclimated to be out of danger.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    A committee of the Senate, after a very full investigation of the
    subject, on the 31st of May, 1880, reported their conclusions to the
    Senate, and both the majority and minority of the committee agreed
    that "a great wrong had been done to the Ponca Indians." The majority
    of the committee say:
</p>
<hr>
<p class="q">
  Nothing can strengthen the Government in a just policy to the
  Indians so much as a demonstration of its willingness to do
  ample and complete justice whenever it can be shown that it
  has inflicted a wrong upon a weak and trusting tribe. It is
  impossible for the United States to hope for any confidence to
  be reposed in them by the Indians until there shall be shown
  on their part a readiness to do justice.
</p>
<p>
    The minority report is equally explicit as to the duty of the
    Government to repair the wrong done the Poncas. It says:
</p>
<hr>
<p class="q">
  We should be more prompt and anxious because they are weak
  and we are strong. In my judgment we should be liberal to the
  verge of lavishness in the expenditure of our money to improve
  their condition, so that they and all others may know that,
  although, like all nations and all men, we may do wrong, we
  are willing to make ample reparation.
</p>
<p>
    The report of the commission appointed by me, of which General
    Crook was chairman, and the testimony taken by them and their
    investigations, add very little to what was already contained in the
    official reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the report of
    the Senate committee touching the injustice done to the Poncas by
    their removal to the Indian Territory. Happily, however, the evidence
    reported by the commission and their recommendations point out
    conclusively the true measures of redress which the Government of the
    United States ought now to adopt.
</p>
<p>
    The commission in their conclusions omit to state the important facts
    as to the present condition of the Poncas in the Indian Territory, but
    the evidence they have reported shows clearly and conclusively
    that the Poncas now residing in that Territory, 521 in number, are
    satisfied with their new homes; that they are healthy, comfortable,
    and contented, and that they have freely and firmly decided to adhere
    to the choice announced in their letter of October 25, 1880, and
    in the declaration of December 27, 1880, to remain in the Indian
    Territory and not to return to Dakota.
</p>
<p>
    The evidence reported also shows that the fragment of the Ponca
    tribe&mdash;perhaps 150 in number&mdash;which is still in Dakota and Nebraska
    prefer to remain on their old reservation.
</p>
<p>
    In view of these facts I am convinced that the recommendations of the
    commission, together with the declaration of the chiefs of December
    last, if substantially followed, will afford a solution of the Ponca
    question which is consistent with the wishes and interests of
    both branches of the tribe, with the settled Indian policy of the
    Government, and, as nearly as is now practicable, with the demands of
    justice.
</p>
<p>
    Our general Indian policy for the future should embrace the following
    leading ideas:
</p>
<p>
    1. The Indians should be prepared for citizenship by giving to their
    young of both sexes that industrial and general education which
    is required to enable them to be self-supporting and capable of
    self-protection in a civilized community.
</p>
<p>
    2. Lands should be allotted to the Indians in severalty, inalienable
    for a certain period.
</p>
<p>
    3. The Indians should have a fair compensation for their lands not
    required for individual allotments, the amount to be invested, with
    suitable safeguards, for their benefit.
</p>
<p>
    4. With these prerequisites secured, the Indians should be
    made citizens and invested with the rights and charged with the
    responsibilities of citizenship.
</p>
<p>
    It is therefore recommended that legislation be adopted in relation to
    the Ponca Indians, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to secure
    to the individual members of the Ponca tribe, in severalty, sufficient
    land for their support, inalienable for a term of years and until the
    restriction upon alienation may be removed by the President. Ample
    time and opportunity should be given to the members of the tribe
    freely to choose their allotments either on their old or their new
    reservation.
</p>
<p>
    Full compensation should be made for the lands to be relinquished, for
    their losses by the Sioux depredations and by reason of their removal
    to the Indian Territory, the amount not to be less than the sums named
    in the declaration of the chiefs made December 27, 1880.
</p>
<p>
    In short, nothing should be left undone to show to the Indians that
    the Government of the United States regards their rights as equally
    sacred with those of its citizens.
</p>
<p>
    The time has come when the policy should be to place the Indians as
    rapidly as practicable on the same footing with the other permanent
    inhabitants of our country.
</p>
<p>
    I do not undertake to apportion the blame for the injustice done to
    the Poncas. Whether the Executive or Congress or the public is chiefly
    in fault is not now a question of practical importance. As the Chief
    Executive at the time when the wrong was consummated, I am deeply
    sensible that enough of the responsibility for that wrong justly
    attaches to me to make it my particular duty and earnest desire to
    do all I can to give to these injured people that measure of redress
    which is required alike by justice and by humanity.

    VETO MESSAGE.
</h2>
<p class="r">
    EXECUTIVE MANSION, <i>March 3, 1881</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <i>To the House of Representatives</i>:
</p>
<p>
    Having considered the bill entitled "An act to facilitate the
    refunding of the national debt," I am constrained to return it to the
    House of Representatives, in which it originated, with the following
    statement of my objections to its passage:
</p>
<p>
    The imperative necessity for prompt action and the pressure of public
    duties in this closing week of my term of office compel me to refrain
    from any attempt to make a full and satisfactory presentation of the
    objections to the bill.
</p>
<p>
    The importance of the passage at the present session of Congress of a
    suitable measure for the refunding of the national debt which is
    about to mature is generally recognized. It has been urged upon the
    attention of Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and in my last
    annual message. If successfully accomplished, it will secure a large
    decrease in the annual interest payment of the nation, and I earnestly
    recommend, if the bill before me shall fail, that another measure for
    this purpose be adopted before the present Congress adjourns.
</p>
<p>
    While, in my opinion, it would be unwise to authorize the Secretary of
    the Treasury, in his discretion, to offer to the public bonds bearing
    3-1/2 per cent interest in aid of refunding, I should not deem it my
    duty to interpose my constitutional objection to the passage of the
    present bill if it did not contain, in its fifth section, provisions
    which, in my judgment, seriously impair the value and tend to the
    destruction of the present national banking system of the country.
    This system has now been in operation almost twenty years. No safer or
    more beneficial banking system was ever established. Its advantages
    as a business are free to all who have the necessary capital. It
    furnishes a currency to the public which for convenience and security
    of the bill holder has probably never been equaled by that of any
    other banking system. Its notes are secured by the deposit with the
    Government of the interest-bearing bonds of the United States.
</p>
<p>
    The section of the bill before me which relates to the national
    banking system, and to which objection is made, is not an essential
    part of a refunding measure. It is as follows:
</p>
<p class="q">
  SEC. 5. From and after the 1st day of July, 1881, the 3 per
  cent bonds authorized by the first section of this act shall
  be the only bonds receivable as security for national-bank
  circulation or as security for the safe-keeping and prompt
  payment of the public money deposited with such banks; but
  when any such bonds deposited for the purposes aforesaid shall
  be designated for purchase or redemption by the Secretary
  of the Treasury, the banking association depositing the same
  shall have the right to substitute other issues of the bonds
  of the United States in lieu thereof: <i>Provided</i>, That no bond
  upon which interest has ceased shall be accepted or shall be
  continued on deposit as security for circulation or for
  the safe-keeping of the public money; and in case bonds so
  deposited shall not be withdrawn, as provided by law, within
  thirty days after the interest has ceased thereon, the banking
  association depositing the same shall be subject to the
  liabilities and proceedings on the part of the Comptroller
  provided for in section 5234 of the Revised Statutes of the
  United States: <i>And provided further</i>, That section 4 of the
  act of June 20, 1874, entitled "An act fixing the amount of
  United States notes, providing for a redistribution of the
  national-bank currency, and for other purposes," be, and the
  same is hereby, repealed, and sections 5159 and 5160 of the
  Revised Statutes of the United States be, and the same are
  hereby, reenacted.
</p>
<p>
    Under this section it is obvious that no additional banks will
    hereafter be organized, except possibly in a few cities or localities
    where the prevailing rates of interest in ordinary business are
    extremely low. No new banks can be organized and no increase of the
    capital of existing banks can be obtained except by the purchase and
    deposit of 3 per cent bonds. No other bonds of the United States can
    be used for the purpose. The one thousand millions of other bonds
    recently issued by the United States, and bearing a higher rate of
    interest than 3 per cent, and therefore a better security for the bill
    holder, can not after the 1st of July next be received as security
    for bank circulation. This is a radical change in the banking law. It
    takes from the banks the right they have heretofore had under the law
    to purchase and deposit as security for their circulation any of the
    bonds issued by the United States, and deprives the bill holder of the
    best security which the banks are able to give by requiring them
    to deposit bonds having the least value of any bonds issued by the
    Government.
</p>
<p>
    The average rate of taxation of capital employed in banking is more
    than double the rate of taxation upon capital employed in other
    legitimate business. Under these circumstances, to amend the banking
    law so as to deprive the banks of the privilege of securing their
    notes by the most valuable bonds issued by the Government will, it is
    believed, in a large part of the country, be a practical prohibition
    of the organization of new banks and prevent the existing banks from
    enlarging their capital. The national banking system, if continued at
    all, will be a monopoly in the hands of those already engaged in it,
    who may purchase the Government bonds bearing a more favorable rate of
    interest than the 3 per cent bonds prior to next July.
</p>
<p>
    To prevent the further organization of banks is to put in jeopardy the
    whole system, by taking from it that feature which makes it, as it
    now is, a banking system free upon the same terms to all who wish
    to engage in it. Even the existing banks will be in danger of being
    driven from business by the additional disadvantages to which they
    will be subjected by this bill. In short, I can not but regard
    the fifth section of the bill as a step in the direction of the
    destruction of the national banking system.
</p>
<p>
    Our country, after a long period of business depression, has just
    entered upon a career of unexampled prosperity.
</p>
<p>
    The withdrawal of the currency from circulation of the national
    banks, and the enforced winding up of the banks in consequence, would
    inevitably bring serious embarrassment and disaster to the business
    of the country. Banks of issue are essential instruments of modern
    commerce. If the present efficient and admirable system of banking is
    broken down, it will inevitably be followed by a recurrence to other
    and inferior methods of banking. Any measure looking to such a result
    will be a disturbing element in our financial system. It will destroy
    confidence and surely check the growing prosperity of the country.
</p>
<p>
    Believing that a measure for refunding the national debt is not
    necessarily connected with the national banking law, and that any
    refunding act would defeat its own object if it imperiled the national
    banking system or seriously impaired its usefulness, and convinced
    that section 5 of the bill before me would, if it should become a
    law, work great harm, I herewith return the bill to the House of
    Representatives for that further consideration which is provided for
    in the Constitution.

</p>
<p>
    In view of the well-known fact that the sale of intoxicating liquors

<p>
    <i>It is therefore directed</i>, That the Secretary of War take suitable

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
